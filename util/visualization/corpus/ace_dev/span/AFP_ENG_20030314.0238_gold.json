(AFP)\u3002\nEfforts were to continue at the United Nations Friday to find a\nbreakthrough in the diplomatic stalemate on Iraq, with Washington\nwarning it could bypass the Security Council and go to war alone.\u3002\nWith marathon talks at the top world body failing late Thursday to\nreconcile French and Russian opposition to US-British war plans, the\nUnited States upped its military presence, deploying more\nmissile-firing warships to the Red Sea.\u3002\nSix non-permanent members of the Security Council considered to be in\nthe middle ground between the fiercely pro- and anti-war camps, were\nworking on new proposals to break the deadlock, France's ambassador\nto the UN said.\u3002\n\"The six are now working on a paper and we will see the outcome of\nthat consultation, maybe tomorrow (Friday)\" Jean-Marc de La Sabliere\ntold reporters.\u3002\nIraq was due to present a 30-page report on biological weapons it\nsaid it destroyed in 1991, according to diplomatic sources in\nBaghdad, who said a second batch of documents on anthrax would follow\nin the next few days.\u3002\nAmid talk of delaying or even shelving a US-British resolution giving\nIraqi President Saddam Hussein until Monday to disarm or face war,\noil prices in Asia pulled back, shares rose and the US dollar eased.\u3002\nBritish efforts to provide a way out of the diplomatic mire at the\nUnited Nations ended without agreement late Thursday, but with\nLondon's ambassador to the UN, Jeremy Greenstock, saying he expected\ntalks to go on into the weekend.\u3002\nHis US counterpart, John Negroponte, said: \"I can't say we are much\nfarther along today than we were yesterday,\" after hours of talks on\nsix British benchmarks to test Iraq's compliance with council\ndemands.\u3002\nThe tests were designed to sway six uncommitted council members\nbehind a draft resolution which would declare that Iraq has missed\nits last chance to disarm peacefully unless the council decides\notherwise by Monday.\u3002\nThe two allies would not push for a vote Friday on the draft\nresolution, diplomats at the United Nations said, while US Secretary\nof State Colin Powell hinted that Washington would consider not even\nputting the text to a vote.\u3002\n\"We are still talking to the members of the council with respect to\ncoalescing around a position that wouldn't draw a veto, but the\noptions remain: go for a vote and see what members say, or not go for\na vote,\" Powell said.\u3002\n\"We will be examining them today, tomorrow and into the weekend,\" he\nsaid late Thursday.\u3002\nDiplomatic wrangling has centred around the French and Russian\nrefusal to put their names to any resolution allowing the United\nStates to unleash its military might against Iraq before weapons\ninspections have run their course.\u3002\nFrance has provoked Washington's ire in its steadfast insistence that\nit will veto any resolution paving the way for war, even rejecting\nthe British proposals for concrete tests before Baghdad had done so.\u3002\nFrance's threat to cast its veto was only making war more likely,\nBritish Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said.\u3002\n\"Unfortunately they appear to have made the decision not to enforce\n(UN resolution) 1441,\" Straw told Britain's The Guardian newspaper.\n\"That renders it less likely that we get a peaceful outcome.\"\u3002\nRussian Deputy Foreign Minister Yury Fedotov said the US decision to\ndrop demands for a Security Council vote this week on war with Iraq\nshowed the resolution had not won enough support.\u3002\nHe rejected the British proposals, saying: \"The British proposals on\nIraq are not constructive and do not resolve the key problem, the\nprevention of a military scenario involving Baghdad,\" the Interfax\nnews agency reported.\u3002\nHe repeated that Moscow would not back a resolution that authorised\nan attack against Iraq: \"It is not necessary now to adopt any new\nresolution on Iraq, especially resolutions which lead to war.\"\u3002\nHis comments were echoed by the German ambassador to the UN, Gunter\nPleuger, who said: \"There is no majority support for the British\nproposal.\"\u3002\nIn Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said that weapons inspectors\nhad to be allowed to continue their work.\u3002\n\"Together with our friends in France, with Russia, China and the\nmajority of the security council we are confident the disarmament of\nIraq can be achieved through peaceful means,\" Schroeder said.\u3002\nThe British-US proposal needs nine votes to pass through the\n15-member Security Council -- a feat looking increasingly unlikely\nwith France and Russia vowing to veto the resolution and Syria, China\nand Germany all opposing.\u3002\nThe United States meanwhile deployed its B-2 stealth bombers to\npositions closer to Iraq and ordered as many as 15 warships capable\nof firing Tomahawk cruise missiles to the Red Sea from the\nMediterranean, US officials said.\u3002\n\n\n",
