Bush discussed\nthe effort to oust Saddam Hussein, which some senior US military\nofficials warn could last months.\u3002\nAbout 1,000 soldiers from the US Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade\nparachuted into an airfield in a Kurdish-controlled area of northern\nIraq, establishing a base through which to bring in more troops and\ntanks, Pentagon officials said.\u3002\nAnd some 12,000 soldiers from the US Army's 4th Infantry Division,\nwhich was supposed to have gone into northern Iraq through Turkey,\nbegan flying out of Fort Hood, Texas, Thursday to the region, a\nmilitary fort spokeswoman told AFP.\u3002\nThe soldiers are to meet up with ships transporting their equipment,\nwhich is arriving in Kuwait from the Mediterranean, where it had been\nidling for weeks on navy ships awaiting Turkey's decision.\u3002\nThe war in Iraq could last months and require considerable US\nmilitary reinforcements to assure a victory, the Washington Post\nreported Thursday, quoting senior US military officials.\u3002\nSandstorms, dangerously long supply lines and a recalcitrant enemy\n\"has led to a broad reassessment by some top generals of US military\nexpectations and timelines,\" the Post reports.\u3002\n\"Tell me how this ends,\" one senior officer asked the Post.\u3002\nMost US army commanders believe it is critical to pause the breakneck\nadvance towards Baghdad to secure the supply lines and make sure\nweapons are operable and troops resupplied after days of powerful\nsandstorms and damage inflicted by Iraqi attacks, the Post reports.\u3002\nThe Post also quoted Central Intelligence Agency and Pentagon\nintelligence analysts complaining that Bush officials largely ignored\ntheir warning that Iraqi irregular forces would use guerrilla tactics\nand offer significant resistance.\u3002\nPublicly US officials have insisted that the war is going according\nto plan, and the most advanced US forces are currently some 100\nkilometers (60 miles) outside of Baghdad.\u3002\nUS Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld dismissed worries that there\nwere insufficient forces in the Gulf region if the battle for Baghdad\ngoes wrong.\u3002\nAfter briefing US senators on the war, Rumsfeld told reporters that\nthe number of forces \"has been increasing and it will continue to do\nso until it is finished.\"\u3002\nMeanwhile Blair arrived in Washington late Wednesday for two days of\ntalks with Bush at the Camp David presidential retreat. Talks were to\nfocus on how to run a post-Saddam Iraq, with Washington resisting a\nlarge United Nations role.\u3002\nBlair faces an uphill battle to win Bush over to giving the UN\noversight of a post-Saddam administration, as Washington officials\nare still angry at Germany, Russia, and especially France, over the\nfailure to secure UN Security Council approval for military action.\u3002\nBlair and Bush were to hold a joint press conference at 1600 GMT\nThursday.\u3002\nBritain has deployed some 45,000 troops to fight with the more than\n250,000 US soldiers lined up against Iraqi troops.\u3002\nBush gave a new, stronger warning that the war could become drawn\nout.\u3002\n\"As they approach Baghdad, our fighting units are facing the most\ndesperate elements of a doomed regime,\" Bush told cheering military\npersonnel Wednesday at the Florida headquarters of Central Command,\nwhich is running the campaign.\u3002\n\"We cannot predict the final day of the Iraqi regime, but I can\nassure you -- and I assure the long-suffering people of Iraq -- there\nwill be a day of reckoning for the Iraqi regime, and that day is\ndrawing near,\" he said.\u3002\nAt the last minute, Bush withdrew a phrase in his speech saying the\ncampaign was \"ahead of schedule.\" A senior administration official\nsaid the president had decided to be cautious.\u3002\nBush pointedly paid tribute to the 48-nation \"coalition of the\nwilling\" -- particularly Britain -- that is publicly backing the\ncampaign.\u3002\nSeparately, US Secretary of State Colin Powell emphasized US\ndetermination to pursue the military campaign despite the diplomatic\npressure Washington faces at the United Nations.\u3002\n\"We are interested in concluding this conflict, not having a pause\nright now or stopping right now, but concluding this as quickly as\npossible so we can get on with the rebuilding of Iraq and putting in\nplace a better system of governance,\" Powell said in an interview\nwith the Al-Jazeera Arab television network.\u3002\nPowell, the most moderate member of the Bush cabinet, said he fully\nagreed with the president's policy on Iraq and had no plans to leave.\u3002\n\"Personally, I'm very much in sync with the president and he values\nmy services,\" he said in an interview with National Public Radio.\u3002\nMeanwhile the Wall Street Journal reported that several British and\nUS oil companies have quietly advised US and British forces on how\noil fields operate so they could safeguard the fields in Iraq.\u3002\nThe companies, including Britain's BP PLC and the Texas-based Boots\nand Coots International Well Control Inc., were not paid for their\nconsultations, but allied military engineers said their advice was\ncritical.\u3002\nbur-ch/\u3002\nIraq-war-US\u3002\n\n\n",
