We don't want to lose the\ncontributions of this board member, but this has become a financial issue.\nThanks.\u3002\n\n\n               \n                                 \n Re: Board Member Compensation \u3002\nLynn\u3002\nIf your organization is a charity, it is generally considered to be\ninappropriate, and in some jurisdictions, it is illegal to compensate board\nmembers for their service. You should check out the law in your state and/or\ncountry.\u3002\nIt is reasonable, however, to reimburse board members for legitimate and\nnecessary expenses incurred in order to serve on the board. I wonder if\nyou could make a case for paying someone to replace the board member so the\nboard member can attend meetings. I'm not a lawyer, but it seems to me to be\nsimilar to reimbursing a board member for a babysitter, which no one\nquestions.\u3002\nAnother possibility is to change the meeting times.\u3002\nNathan\u3002\n    \n\n\n\n      \n                                 \n Re: Board Member Compensation \u3002\nWe are incorporated in Maryland. There are just 5 of us on the board (we\nare a charity 501(c)(3), although we all live in different states from coast\nto coast. It is very difficult to find times for all of us to get together.\nWould I need to check the Maryland law or the law in the state in which this\nboard member lives?\u3002\nThanks.\u3002    \n\n\n\n            \n                                 \n Re: Board Member Compensation \u3002\n    \n\nIn IRS Publication 557, the sample draft articles of incorporation\nindicate that NO compensation may be paid to directors. In\nfairness, reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses on behalf of the\norganization -- including travel and lodging to attend board\nmeetings -- are allowed. However, Publication 557 does not\nexplicitly prohibit compensation to directors.\u3002\nAs far as state laws go, you must follow the laws for the states\n(1) in which the organization is incorporated and (2) in which the\norganization operates. For an organization that is incorporated in\nMaryland and has its headquarters in Maryland, the laws of Maryland\napply without regard to the states in which the directors live.\nRemember, a corporation is legally a \"person\", distinct from the\ncorporeal persons who govern, manage, and operate the corporation.\nThus, the laws applying to the corporate person are the laws of the\nstate where that person \"lives\".\u3002\n--\u3002\nDavid E.

Many do this,\nas they know it is an investment for the time and talents they need.\u3002\nThey also know, as do the recipients, the payment is but a percentage of the\ntrue worth of the time and effort, but does show respect for what they are\nrecieving.\u3002\n    \n\n\n\n      \n                                 \n Re: Board Member Compensation \u3002\nIs there anyone who knows of a precedent for this being done for a\nnon-profit in the U.S.?\u3002\nThanks!\u3002    \n\n\n\n           \n                               \n Re: Board Member Compensation \u3002\nYes. Some Head Start agencies, Community Health Centers, and similar nonprofit\norganizations serving low-income people have a requirement for \"consumer\"\nrepresentation on their boards. Transportation cost reimbursement, child care\naccommodation, provision of meals, etc., can be done either in-kind or in cash.\u3002\n\n\n           \n                               \n Re: Board Member Compensation \u3002\n\n    \n\nMichael L.

It is not acceptable policy and not legal to pay an honorarium or\nstipend to directors of charities. I checked with a lawyer familiar with\nCanadian charity law, who explained that it is not permitted to remunerate\nboard members of charities for their service as board members. The\nprohibition does not apply to directors of nonprofit organizations that are\nnot charities.\u3002\nIn the USA, the rules vary from state to state. Some states permit board\nmembers of charities to be compensated, but it is generally not done.\nDonors, funders, and the general public share the view that directors of\ncharities should act gratuitiously. It is permitted everywhere, however, to\nreimburse directors for necessary expenses incurred in order to serve. If\nyour organization is a charity, you need to check your state law and act\nvery carefully if you are considering paying board members.\u3002\nNathan\u3002\n    \n\n\n\n\n                   \n                               \n Re: Board Member Compensation \u3002\nBeing someone that works and lives in Canada, and in the non-profit\nindustry, it is done, and it is very legal.\u3002\nTake a look at any of the large student unions, they all pay their elected\nboard members an honorarium, as do many of the large foundations.\u3002\nIt is legal, and it is done.\u3002\n    \n\n\n\n\n",
