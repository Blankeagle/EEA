Orders went out today to deploy 17,000 U.S. Army soldiers\nin the Persian Gulf region. The army's entire first Calvary division\nbased at Fort Hood, Texas, would join the quarter million U.S. forces\nalready in the region. We're talking about possibilities of full scale\nwar with former Congressman Tom Andrews, Democrat of Maine. He's now\nnational director of Win Without War, and former Congressman Bob Dornan,\nRepublican of California.\u3002\n\n        \nBob, one of the reasons I think so many Americans are worried about this\nwar and so many people around the world don't want to go is there have\nbeen a lot of problems with credibility from this administration. Our\npresident has repeatedly, for example, relied on a man whom you're aware,\nHussein Kamel, Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, leader of the Iraq arms\nprogram who defected for a time. And gave us a whole lot of information\nand then went home and his father-in-law killed him. Bad move. But while\nhe was here, he gave us a whole lot of information. Gave us a whole lot\nof information. Well, our president told us that information proves that\nthe dictator had chemical weapons, which is true. But what we just\nlearned this week from \"Newsweek\" magazine which got a hold of the\ndebriefings, is that he also told us it was destroyed back in 1995. Why\nhasn't our president told us that? Why do we have to learn it from\n\"Newsweek\"?\u3002\n\n        \nI don't believe that he believed it was all destroyed. The fact that this\nguy was such an idiot to go back and let his father-in-law kill him shows\nhe wasn't the most stable of people. But the things that...\u3002\n\n        \nGood point. But shouldn't our president have told us what the CIA told\nhim. Why do we learn from \"Newsweek?\"Should he level with us?\u3002\n\n        \nPaul, look, the problem is I would stipulate all four of us hates war.\nAny rational person hates war. Bush isn't sitting in that White House not\nthinking about the body bags coming home with great young men. Clinton\nsuffered greatly over the 19 Rangers that died, 18 on the 3rd of October\nand Matt Reersen (ph) three days later. I visited all their families. I\nwas at the medal of honor ceremony for the kids. Let me tell you, what\ntrips to Walter Reed taught me was, that whoever thought up the term, the\nlaw of unintended consequences it pertains to war. I am shook over the\naftermath. But, this guy is a monster, a mini-me Hitler. He will blow a\ncity off the earth in a minute if he can get the hold of the means to do\nit.\u3002\n\n       \nTom Andrews, I think we all realize that a government doesn't go to war a\nnation goes to war. And so I would like you to take a look at the\nCNN/\"USA TODAY\"/Gallup poll, taken last week, should U.S. troops to go to\nIraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power. Take a look at it. Favor 59%,\nopposed 37%, that's a vastly larger support than President Bush Senior\nhad in getting the U.S. troops out of Kuwait before that war started.\nThat's pretty good support isn't it?\u3002\n\n         \nNow, Bob, come on you don't really buy this. I mean, listen, this is the\noldest trick in the book. You can have a general question like this that\ncould mean anything and ask people and they give you what comes off the\ntop of their head. But, ask them another question, ask them what they\nthink about spending $1.3 trillion in destroying this economy. Ask them\nabout going and not just a war, Bob, but an invasion and occupying for up\nto 10 years a sovereign Arab nation in the midst of one of the most\ndistable and volatile regions in the world. Ask them how they feel about\ngetting bogged down. Well, I've seen some of the figures. Once you start\ntelling Americans the story, -- the administration refuse today tell us\nstory. They're not coming forward and telling us what the risks are, what\nthe costs are, how many years we might be in, the possibility of us\ngetting bogged down, because what Americans know that, they're opposed to\nthis war. The more they learn about this invasion, the more they learn\nabout this occupation, the less they support it.\u3002\n\n        \nTom, you know what liberals want. They don't want a smoking gun, they\nwant a smoking city. The Clinton people all say...\u3002\n\n        \nThat's going to have to be last war, unfair and unfortunate as that is, I\nam sorry, they're telling us we're out of time. Former Congressman, Bob\nDornan from California...\u3002\n\n        \nYou're not going to get a smoking city.\u3002\n\n\n\n",
