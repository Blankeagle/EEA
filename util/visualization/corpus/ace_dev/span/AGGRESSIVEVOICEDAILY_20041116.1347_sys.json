He was probably running around being\nshot at for days on end in Falluja. There should be an investigation but\nthey should look into the circumstances,\" said Lance Corporal\nChristopher Hanson.\u3002\n\"I would have shot the insurgent too. Two shots to the head,\" said\nSergeant Nicholas Graham, 24, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. \"You can't\ntrust these people. He should not be investigated. He did nothing\nwrong.\" Of course the anti-American world press is jumping all over this\nstory, casually omitting the fact that just a day earlier the marine in\nquestion lost a fellow soldier who was attending to a dead insurgent\nthat was booby-trapped with explosives.\u3002\nAdd the tactic of booby-trapping your own dead to the effective\nsuicide bombings, and it's clear to say that the Geneva Convention isn't\non the minds of the insurgents. For that I believe the Marines should\nhandle dead and wounded insurgents by any means necessary to ensure\ntheir own safety and prevent a possible ambush. I'm no fan of this war\neither, but it irks me to no end reading and listening to civilian\nopinions on how soldiers should conduct themselves in hostile war zones\nfrom their comfortable recliners.\u3002\nTo the world press and everyone else who despises the United States:\nYou don't have to like our president or those operating this war, but\nget off the backs of the 18, 19 and 20 year-olds thrown into a situation\nyou will never see or have to encounter. I've got too many friends in\nIraq right now I want to see come home alive and well, and I will\nsupport them at every opportunity.\u3002\n\n\n\n",
