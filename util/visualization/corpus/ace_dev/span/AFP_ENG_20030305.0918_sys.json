The army said two soldiers were also among the dead.\u3002\nThe bus was ripped to shreds while travelling between a residential\narea and Haifa university. Of the 33 injured still in hospital late\nWednesday, two were in intensive care and six others in serious\ncondition, the radio said.\u3002\nIsrael's night-time raid in Gaza involving around 40 tanks and\narmoured vehicles came after Prime Minister Ariel Sharon convened his\nsecurity cabinet to discuss a response to the bomb attack.\u3002\nIsraeli media said the retaliation was unlikely to be on a scale that\nwould risk disrupting US preparations for war on Iraq.\u3002\nThe Palestinian suicide bomber on the Haifa bus came from the\nsouthern West Bank town of Hebron, public radio said, naming him as\n20-year-old Mahmoud Hamadan Salim Qawasmi.\u3002\nApart from his ID card, also found in the wreckage were the remains\nof a letter allegedly outlining his plan to carry out a suicide\nattack and praising the September 2001 destruction of the World Trade\nCentre in New York, it said.\u3002\nIsraeli police were not immediately available for comment, but\nPalestinian sources in Hebron said Mahmoud Qawasmi was a 21-year-old\nstudent with links to the Islamic radical group Hamas.\u3002\nIsraeli forces moved into Hebron's Al-Sheikh district where his\nfamily lived and arrested Qawasmi's brother and father after the\nbombing, they said.\u3002\nWithout claiming responsibility, Hamas and another hardline group,\nIslamic Jihad, said the blast was revenge for a string of bloody\nIsraeli army raids into the Gaza Strip in recent weeks.\u3002\nBut the Palestinian Authority condemned the attack, saying it would\ndivert international sympathy away from the far higher Palestinian\ncivilian death toll.\u3002\n\"We condemn all attacks against civilians including today's attack in\nHaifa,\" said information minister Yasser Abed Rabbo.\u3002\nThe Palestinian leadership said the attack would serve as \"a pretext\nfor Israel's government and occupation army to step up its deadly\ncampaign which caused the deaths of 77 Palestinians in February\".\u3002\nIt was the first bomb attack inside Israel since January 5, and came\njust days after the hawkish Sharon appointed the most right-wing\ngovernment in Israel's history on a pledge to get tough on security.\u3002\nIn the January attack, two Palestinian suicide bombers blew\nthemselves up in central Tel Aviv, killing 23 other people.\u3002\nIsraeli government spokesman Avi Pazner called the latest deadly\nblast a \"very grave attack\" and said the Jewish state would take\n\"vigorous action against the terrorist organisations\".\u3002\nHe told AFP that Israeli intelligence had been dealing with at least\n40 tip-offs of impending attacks when the Haifa bus was blown up.\u3002\nUS President George W. Bush condemned the \"attack on innocents in\nIsrael,\" White House spokesman Ari Fleischer said, adding that \"his\nmessage to the terrorists is: Their efforts will not be succcessful.\u3002\n\"He will continue to pursue the path to peace in the Middle East.\"\u3002\nEU foreign policy supremo Javier Solana likewise slammed the attack,\nalthough he also took a jab at Israel, saying, \"There have been too\nmany civilians killed in the last weeks and the last days.\"\u3002\nIn London, a spokesman for the British prime minister said Tony Blair\n\"condemns absolutely what has happened\".\u3002\nThe spokesman added that he \"would obviously call on all sides to do\nwhat they can to break the cycle of violence, because it is only\nthrough engagement that we can realise the vision everyone wants to\nsee.\u3002\n\"There needs to be dialogue in order for this to be resolved.\"\u3002\nThe bus attack came just two days after Israeli forces staged a\nbloody raid into a refugee camp in central Gaza targeting a founding\nmember of Hamas, which has spearheaded suicide bombings against the\nJewish state.\u3002\nHamas vowed to continue its attacks, while the Palestinian Authority\naccused Israel of trying to disrupt top-level Palestinian meetings to\ndiscuss reforms of Arafat's administration.\u3002\nPalestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erakat said international\nintervention was needed to break the cycle of violence.\u3002\nEight people, including a pregnant woman and a 13-year-old child were\nkilled in Monday's Gaza raid, provoking US-led international calls\nfor Israeli restraint.\u3002\nAnd on Tuesday, Israeli troops shot dead an elderly Palestinian\nshepherd outside a Jewish settlement on the edge of Gaza City.\u3002\nIn the West Bank, an eight-year-old Palestinian boy as well as his\nbrother and a sister were wounded late Wednesday by Israeli gunfire\nin a village north of the town of Ramallah, their elder sister said.\u3002\n\n\n",
