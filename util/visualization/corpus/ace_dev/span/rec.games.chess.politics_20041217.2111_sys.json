Of course\nit's in the bylaws that an active board member cannot be given money by the\nUSCF while on the board. It ought to be pretty obvious that it would be\nentirely contrary to the spirit of this for an active board member to be\nmoney after leaving the board. Suppose, for example, there were to be a\nproposal to the effect that each EB member would be given $10,000 upon the\nexpiration of his/her term. Clearly this would be a transparent attempt to\nevade the bylaws and would fail. If the board cannot vote to give\nthemselves present money, they cannot vote to give themselves future money\neither.\u3002\nFurthermore, it doesn't matter whether this arrangement is embodied in an EB\nvote or not, or whether the discussion of the proposal takes place in a\nformal EB meeting or not. A board member, while on the board, is supposed\nto be representing the interests of the USCF, not feathering his/her nest,\nin the present or in the future. If a board member makes such arrangements,\nit is clearly an ethics violation, clearly a violation of the bylaws,\npossibly endangers our tax-exempt status, and is possibly a violation of law\nas well.\u3002\nThe purpose of having a \"time limit\" would be as a mechanism to ensure\ncompliance with the above principles; that is, you would have a time limit\nbecause it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempted to\nviolate the above prohibition; it would give the voters time to elect a new\nEB that would consider the issues objectively.\u3002\nOf course, it is possible that someone could leave the board -without- ever\nhaving discussed being compensated by the board in the future, and that then\nthe remaining members could, for good reason, hire that person. It would\ncreate questions among the suspicious - and avoiding this appearance of\nwrongdoing would be another good reason for a time limit - but it wouldn't\nautomatically be an ethics or bylaws violation.\u3002\nBut this is neither here nor there, because the fact that Randy Bauer is\nalready talking about Beatriz Marinello as the USCF's new \"move\ncoordinator\", whatever that involves, and whether or not it means that she\nwould be the de facto interim ED, means that at some level and in some form\nthese discussions HAVE already taken place, while Marinello is serving as\nPresident. I mean, it's conceivable that the other six have all gotten\ntogether in Marinello's absence and drafted her, but it also seems pretty\nclear that she has agreed to do it, and, if all the rumors are true and she\nsteps down, it will be so that she can take on these new responsibilities.\nSo the 'time limit' issue doesn't even come up. We pretty much know that\nMarinello, while on the board, has arranged to get future money from the\nUSCF. So we already have a problem. If this is NOT a problem, I wish\nsomeone would explain to me why not.\u3002\nNow, Stan B. argues that Marinello's services are in fact indispensible as\nmove coordinator, and that ethics standards are not a suicide pact, so that\nsince we absolutely NEED her the EB has the right to go ahead and retain\nher. I agree with the principle. But I think that to make this argument\nwork the EB would have to produce some evidence that Marinello really IS\nindispensible for this task. This would have to include evidence that the\nEB had considered all the alternatives, including:\u3002\n- delegating the whole thing to the Interim ED, which would be the normal\npractice in normal organizations with an ED\u3002\n- asking the Interim ED to designate someone from the New Windsor staff to\nact as move coordinator\u3002\n- asking the Interim ED to hire some other consultant with experience in\noffice relocation to manage the job (there are such people)\u3002\n- conducting some kind of actual search for candidates for the position\nduring the last two months since the move was decided upon\u3002\nIf they did consider alternatives, it would also have to include evidence\nthat Marinello has much more experience at relocating offices than other\npeople, or is willing to do the job cheaper (although this wouldn't\nconstitute being \"indispensible\" in my view).\u3002\nIf, however, they just looked around the room and said \"who is going to\nmanage this?\" and someone said, \"Beatriz, how about you?\", this does not\nconstitute proof that her services are indispensible, and thus it wouldn't\ninterfere with my belief that there has been an ethics violation and a\nbylaws violation.\u3002\nOne very bad argument that was made by Kevin Bachler, which to be fair was\nsurrounded by arguably better ones, was that since this board was elected,\nwe should let them do as they please. Which is to say that there might as\nwell not be bylaws, ethics standards, laws, etc., since an elected board is\nnot bound by any of them. I think this idea should be rejected.\u3002\nAnother argument, which is better but still disturbing, is that, yes, this\nis an ethics violation, and maybe worse, but it would only hurt the USCF to\ntalk about it, and that only troublemakers like Sam Sloan, Larry Parr, and,\nI suppose, me, would talk about it, since doing so will obstruct the\nfederation's plans, cause us to pay legal expenses, run the risk of our\nbeing stuck without any office space at all, cause people not to loan us\nmoney, and so forth. So we should all ignore this because it is realistic\nto do so. I'm not entirely unsympathetic to this, actually. But frankly I\nthink that a whole lot of the problems the USCF has had over the years have\nhad to do with well-intentioned people keeping secrets because bringing them\nout in the open would harm the USCF, and as a result we have awful habits\nwhich hurt the USCF even worse.\u3002\nBut if we are going to talk about realism, here is another realistic\nconcern: I predict that, if, in fact, the rumors about the agenda for the\nFlorida meeting prove true, and Marinello resigns as President and is hired\nas move coordinator, the immediate result of this is that Sam Sloan will\nfile another lawsuit (or amend his current complaint) charging the USCF EB\nmembers with self-dealing, violation of the USCF's own bylaws, and every\nother thing, report us to the IRS, and demand that all USCF moneys which\nmight be used to paid Marinello be frozen. This is not based on any\ncommunication from Sam, direct or indirect. It is just logical. If he is\nwilling to file a lawsuit on the basis of New York non-profit organization\nlaw, which might or might not be applicable to the USCF, why wouldn't he\nfile a lawsuit on the basis of the USCF's violation of its own bylaws, which\nunquestionably ARE applicable to the USCF? I wrote a few days ago quoting\nmy own employer association's attorney, who said that courts mostly let\nassociations do what they want UNLESS they violate their own bylaws. It is\nirritating enough to get sued by Sam Sloan; imagine how irritating it would\nbe to get sued by Sam Sloan and BEATEN by Sam Sloan because you have done\nsomething so egregious that a court is forced to agree with him.\u3002\npetrel\u3002\n\n\n\n\n",
