With me now for more on all this, CNN's senior White House\ncorrespondent John King. John, they have to be happy there.\u3002\n\n                                               \nJudy, they are. Behind the scenes privately here you get a palpable sense\nof vindication, although publicly caution is the watchword here,\nadministration officials from the vice president on down saying the war\nis not over yet. Some of the toughest fighting could still be ahead.\nMostly they believe in those northern Iraq areas Brent Sadler was just\ntalking about before the break. But they do believe the pictures out of\nBaghdad today, on the one hand, send as powerful a message as you can\nsend to the people in the Arab world who have criticized this war. People\nin Baghdad celebrating. U.S. troops assisting in pulling down that statue\nof Saddam Hussein. Across the Arab world, the administration hopes to\nsend a signal that the United States is there to help the Iraqi people\nregain control of their own country, as a liberty, not as any imperial or\noccupying force. Of course, at the same time, though, the White House\nworries that the American people might see these pictures and think the\nwar is over. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney among\nthose saying the toughest fighting might still lie ahead, still\nunanswered questions about the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein and other\nkey members of the Iraqi leadership. The vice president made that\nargument today. But even as he sounds that note of caution, you do sense\na little tiny bit of we told you so.\u3002\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\u3002\n                                                  \nBottom line, with less than half of the ground forces and two-thirds of\nthe air assets used 12 years ago in Desert Storm, Secretary Rumsfeld and\nGeneral Franks have achieved a far more difficult objective. Yet until\nthis war is fully won, we cannot be overconfident in our position. And we\nmust not underestimate the desperation of whatever forces remain loyal to\nthe dictator.\u3002\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\u3002\n      \nWe will not hear from the president today, we are told, but before the\nweek is out and perhaps as early as tomorrow officials say the president\nis likely to offer his thoughts on the challenges just ahead. So, again,\nbehind the scenes, a sense of vindication, but also a cautious attitude\nbecause of the fighting still to come. I have to tell you, though, Judy,\nthe CIA Director George Tenet walked out of the White House a short time\nago with a giant smile on his face. I cannot recall a moment since\nSeptember 11, 2001 and those tragic events when we have seen the CIA\ndirector look so happy.\u3002\n\n          \nWell, John, given all that you've said, we know that there's an American\nretired general waiting in Kuwait. But in addition to that, what steps\nare they already taking at the White House to plan for a post-Saddam\nHussein government in Iraq?\u3002\n\n      \nThey are planning to accelerate that planning process. Jay Garner the\nretired general will go into Iraq soon with his troops soon. I say\ntroops. They are civilians from the U.S. government. That will take place\nsoon. They are awaiting for word from the Pentagon that it believes the\nsecurity environment is secure enough for that to happen. And beginning\nas early as next week, there will be a series of town meetings, if you\nwill. The invitations will be issued by General Tommy Franks. They are\ntrying to identify Iraqis from within the country, as well as Iraqi\ndissidents and exiles, the diaspora they call it here at the White House,\nwho will be part of a planning process to begin the process -- they say\nit could takes weeks or more -- of selecting who should be part of that\ninterim Iraqi authority. Now, we know, one person who will be invited is\nplanning process, those planning meetings, is Ahmed Chalabi. He is the\nleader of the Iraqi National Congress. He is known to be a favorite of\nVice President Dick Cheney, of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary\nRumsfeld's top deputy, Paul Wolfowitz. He will be involved in the\nplanning and in those meetings. But I also should report that there is a\nsense of annoyance here at the White House, even among some of Mr.\nChalabi's top supporters, that, since returning to Iraq in recent days,\nhe has complained frequently, including on our air earlier today, that\nthe United States is moving too slowly to get in the reconstruction\nefforts, to restore electricity and restore water. Over at the Pentagon\ntoday, Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, again, a supporter of Mr. Chalabi,\nsaid that, in his view, services were already at their prewar levels. And\nMr. Rumsfeld went on to say, Secretary Rumsfeld went on to say, there is\nstill a war going on, still quite a dangerous situation -- Judy.\u3002\n\n          \nYes, we caught some of that irritation in his choice. All right, John\nKing, our senior White House correspondent, thank you. Still to come:\nwarfare amid the celebrations in Baghdad. As Iraqis poured into the\nstreets to mark their apparent new freedom, American troops come under\nfire from a different area. CNN's Martin Savidge will show us what they\ncame up against at Baghdad University.\u3002\n(NEWS BREAK)\u3002\n\n\n",
