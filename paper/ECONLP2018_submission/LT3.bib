	determine the reading-level of a sample text. Ascertaining the readability
	of curricula is an important step toward optimizing the effectiveness
	of the educational progress. Readability measurements are done using
	manual computation. This is a tedious and time-consuming task. However,
	nowadays, automatic readability computation has gained much popularity
	than ever before. This can be attributed to the advancement in the
	field of natural language processing. Languages such as English and
	Spanish have benefited from the formation of automatic readability
	systems. Absence of automated readability measurement of Arabic texts
	and the large amount of information which are written in Arabic encouraged
	us to work on finding an automatic readability system for our language;
	the mother language for millions of Arabs. In this paper we will
	review the different readability research and then propose a system
	for automating the readability measurement of Arabic text. Within
	the paper we also report the results of our pilot experiment carried
	out on the different well-known Arabic, Swedish and English readability

	the concept of a fuzzy preference structure and to present the resulting
	material in a logical manner. Roughly speaking, three phases can
	be distinguished. In the first phase, different proposais for constructing
	fuzzy strict preference and indifference relations emerge. In the
	second one, this construction is approached in an axiomatic way,
	by imposing couditions on the fuzzy strict preference, indifference
	and incomparability relations, leading to functional equations identifying
	suitabie strict preference, indifference and incomparability generators.
	Surprisingly, the detinition of a fuzzy preference structure was
	only given in the third phase, leading to the study of additive fuzzy
	preference structures. Combined with results from the axiomatic approach,
	this has linally led to the discovery of characterizable fuzzy preference
	structures.},

  abstract = {The problem of merging multiple sources information is central in
	many information processing areas such as databases integrating problems,
	multiple criteria decision making, expert opinion pooling, etc. Recently,
	several approaches have been proposed to merge propositional bases,
	or sets of (non-prioritized) goals. These approaches are in general
	semantically defined. Like in belief revision, they use implicit
	priorities, generally based on Dalal's distance, for merging the
	propositional bases and return a new propositional base as a result.
	An immediate consequence of the generation of a propositional base
	is the impossibility of decomposing and iterating the fusion process
	in a coherent way with respect to priorities since the underlying
	ordering is lost. This paper presents a general approach for fusing
	prioritized bases, both semantically and syntactically, when priorities
	are represented in the possibilistic logic framework. Different classes
	of merging operators are considered depending on whether the sources
	are consistent, conflicting, redundant or independent. We show that
	the approaches which have been recently proposed for merging propositional
	bases can be embedded in this setting. The result is then a prioritized
	base, and hence the process can be coherently decomposed and iterated.
	Moreover, this encoding provides a syntactic counterpart for the
	fusion of propositional bases.},

	a set of queries, these rankings can serve for both evaluation and
	training of retrieval and learning systems. We present a novel approach
	to collecting the individual user preferences over image-search results:
	we use a collaborative game in which players are rewarded for agreeing
	on which image result is best for a query. Our approach is distinct
	from other labeling games because we are able to elicit directly
	the preferences of interest with respect to image queries extracted
	from query logs. As a source of relevance judgments, this data provides
	a useful complement to click data. Furthermore, the data is free
	of positional biases and is collected by the game without the risk
	of frustrating users with non-relevant results; this risk is prevalent
	in standard mechanisms for debiasing clicks. We describe data collected
	over 34 days from a deployed version of this game that amounts to
	about 18 million expressed preferences between pairs. Finally, we
	present several approaches to modeling this data in order to extract
	the consensus rankings from the preferences and better sort the search
	results for targeted queries.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a consensus model for multiperson decision
	making (MPDM) problems with different preference structures based
	on two consensus criteria: 1) a consensus measure which indicates
	the agreement between experts' opinions and 2) a measure of proximity
	to find out how far the individual opinions are from the group opinion.
	These measures are calculated by comparing the positions of the alternatives
	between the individual solutions and collective solution. In such
	a way, the consensus situation is evaluated in each moment in a more
	realistic way. With these measures, we design a consensus support
	system that is able to substitute the actions of the moderator. In
	this system, the consensus measure is used to guide the consensus
	process until the final solution is achieved while the proximity
	measure is used to guide the discussion phases of the consensus process.
	The consensus support system has a feedback mechanism to guide the
	discussion phases based on the proximity measure. This feedback mechanism
	is based on simple and easy rules to help experts change their opinions
	in order to obtain a degree of consensus as high as possible. The
	main improvement of this consensus model is that it supports consensus
	process automatically, without moderator, and, in such a way, the
	possible subjectivity that the moderator can introduce in the consensus
	process is avoided.},

  abstract = {The introduction of the ESP Game and other Games With A Purpose (GWAP)
	has demonstrated the potential of human computation in solving AI-hard
	problems. In such systems, users are normally required to input answers
	for questions proposed by the system, e.g., descriptions about a
	picture or a song. Since users may bring up irrelevant inputs intentionally
	or carelessly, and often the system does not have "correct" answers,
	we have to rely on the users to verify answers from others. We call
	this kind of mutual verification of users' answers "social verification."
	In this paper, we propose formal models for two fundamental social
	verification mechanisms, simultaneous verification and sequential
	verification, in human computation systems. By adopting a game-theoretic
	approach, we perform an equilibrium analysis which explains the effect
	of each verification mechanism on a system's outcome. Our analysis
	results show that sequential verification leads to a more diverse
	and descriptive set of outcomes than simultaneous verification, though
	the latter is stronger in ensuring the correctness of verified answers.
	Our experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk, which asked users to input
	textual terms related to a word, confirmed our analysis results.
	We believe that our formal models for social verification mechanisms
	will provide a basis for the design of future human computation systems.},

	pairing of these methods as two interlocking feedback cycles. This
	paper explores the potential synergy promised if these cycles can
	be made to accelerate each other by exploiting the same edits to
	advance both community content creation and learning-based information
	extraction. We examine our proposed synergy in the context of Wikipedia
	infoboxes and the Kylin information extraction system. After developing
	and refining a set of interfaces to present the verification of Kylin
	extractions as a non primary task in the context of Wikipedia articles,
	we develop an innovative use of Web search advertising services to
	study people engaged in some other primary task. We demonstrate our
	proposed synergy by analyzing our deployment from two complementary
	perspectives: (1) we show we accelerate community content creation
	by using Kylin's information extraction to significantly increase
	the likelihood that a person visiting a Wikipedia article as a part
	of some other primary task will spontaneously choose to help improve
	the article's infobox, and (2) we show we accelerate information
	extraction by using contributions collected from people interacting
	with our designs to significantly improve Kylin's extraction performance.},

	web users. However, designing games that encourage sustainable and
	quality data contribution remains a great challenge. Given that many
	online communities have enjoyed active participation from a loyal
	following, this research explores how human computation games may
	benefit from rich interactions inherent in a community. We experimented
	by implementing two games for commonsense data collection on the
	leading social community platforms: the Rapport Game on Facebook
	and the Virtual Pet Game on PTT. In this paper, we present the choices
	of interaction mode and goal-oriented user model for building a community-based
	game. The data quality, collection efficiency, player retention,
	concept diversity, and game stability of both games are analyzed
	quantitatively from data collected since August/November 2008. Our
	findings should provide useful suggestions for designing community-based
	games in the future.},

	in reading matter. Tables show how these determinants of acceptability
	relate to readability as measured by word and sentence lengths. It
	is hypothesised that long sentences are difficult because comprehension
	depends upon combining cortical patterns evoked by grammatically
	related elements; but in long sentences the pattern evoked by one
	element may have decayed before the next related element is read.
	Long words may cause difficulty because they are generally the more
	precise words, requiring longer to categorise semantically; but the
	longer the search for a word's meaning, the more likely that the
	preceding context will be lost beyond recall.},

	question whether it is possible for a prediction system to automatically
	determine the level of readability of an unseen text. A significant
	problem for such a system is that readability might depend in part
	on the reader. If different readers assess the readability of texts
	in fundamentally different ways, there is insufficient a priori agreement
	to justify the correctness of a readability prediction system based
	on the texts assessed by those readers. We built a data set of readability
	assessments by expert readers. We clustered the experts into groups
	with greater a priori agreement and then measured for each group
	whether classifiers trained only on data from this group exhibited
	a classification bias. As this was found to be the case, the classification
	mechanism cannot be unproblematically generalized to a different
	user group.},

	labels to images - a task which is still difficult for even the most
	advanced systems in image processing. However, the ESP Game as it
	is currently implemented encourages players to assign "obvious" labels,
	which can be easily predicted given previously assigned labels. We
	present a language model which can assign probabilities to the next
	label to be added. This model is then used in a program, which plays
	the ESP game without looking at the image. Even without any use of
	the actual image, the program manages to agree with the randomly
	assigned human partner on a label for 69% of all images, and for
	81% of images which have at least one "off-limits" term assigned
	to them. We discuss how the scoring system and the design of the
	ESP game can be improved to encourage users to add less predictable
	labels, thereby improving the quality of the collected information.},

	methods (deleting content words, every-seventh word, all prepositions,
	and random word deletion) were derived and examined. Results of confirmatory
	factor analyses show that a two-factor model consisting of two sets
	of ``tau-equivalent tests'' was found to fit the data, indicating
	that different methods of word deletion should be used within the
	same cloze test to ensure its validity. Further examination of test
	reliabilities indicate that the rational deletion methods (deleting
	content words and prepositions) produce more reliable tests than
	the mechanical deletion methods (deleting words randomly or deleting
	every seventh word).},

	perform automatically and may not even be aware of. We describe a
	classification system and present results from two experiments as
	proof-of-concept. Results from the first experiment showed that our
	system could classify whether a user was looking at an image of a
	face or not, even when the user was not explicitly trying to make
	this determination. Results from the second experiment extended this
	to animals and inanimate object categories as well, suggesting generality
	beyond face recognition. We further show that we can improve classification
	accuracies if we show images multiple times, potentially to multiple
	people, attaining well above 90% classification accuracies with even
	just ten presentations.},

	for stopping these bots from entering the internet. The best and
	most feasible solution proposed till now has been the CAPTCHA or
	the fuzzy text recognition. But the latest news that hurt the organisations
	that use CAPTCHA is that the bots started recognizing these fuzzy
	texts. In this paper we propose a novel yet simple idea which can
	serve as a replacement to CAPTCHA. There have been several image
	based CAPTCHA's proposed and as well defeated [1]. But our Idea THINK
	is in the same lines yet is fool proof. In this paper we suggest
	that a real time image is used which will portray some action or
	show some object that the user is expected to identify the object
	and type the answer. No choices will be given to the user thereby
	eliminating the option of identifying the answer by probability.},

  abstract = {In the "all pairs bottleneck paths" (APBP) problem, one is given a
	directed graph with real weights on its edges. Viewing the weights
	as capacities, one is asked to determine, for all pairs (s, t) of
	vertices, the maximum amount of flow which can be routed along a
	single path from s to t. The APBP problem was first studied in operations
	research, shortly after the introduction of maximum flows and all
	pairs shortest paths. We present the first truly subcubic algorithm
	for APBP in general dense graphs. In particular, we give a procedure
	for computing the (max, min)-product of two arbitrary matrices over
	R u (infty, -infty) in O(n^{2+omega/3}) < O(n^2.792) time, where
	n is the number of vertices and omega is the exponent for matrix
	multiplication over rings. Max-min products can be used to compute
	the maximum bottleneck values for all pairs of vertices together
	with a "successor matrix" from which one can extract an explicit
	maximum bottleneck path for any pair of vertices in time linear in
	the length of the path.},

	the new approach can take the word sequence, readerpsilas language

  abstract     = {Breaking news on economic events such as stock splits or mergers and acquisitions has been shown to have a substantial impact on the financial markets. As it is important to be able to automatically identify events in news items accurately and in a timely manner, we present in this paper proof-of-concept experiments for a supervised machine learning approach to economic event detection in newswire text. For this purpose, we created a corpus of Dutch financial news articles in which 10 types of company-specific economic events were annotated. We trained classifiers using various lexical, syntactic and semantic features. We obtain good results based on a basic set of shallow features, thus showing that this method is a viable approach for economic event detection in news text.},
