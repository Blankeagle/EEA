Makes sense right?\u3002\nAs rising instability in Lebanon increases tensions in the Middle\nEast, the Bush administration is arguing with European governments over\nwhether they should designate the Lebanon-based Shiite group Hezbollah a\nterrorist organization, American and European officials say.\u3002\nThe United States is already stepping up pressure on Iran and Syria,\nHezbollah's main sponsors. The American rift with Syria deepened this\nweek, with suspicions that Syria might have been behind the\nassassination of Lebanon's former prime minister in Beirut on Monday.\u3002\n...\u3002\nIn the past two weeks, the officials said, France has rebuffed\nappeals by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the Israeli foreign\nminister, Silvan Shalom, to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization,\nwhich would prevent it from raising money in Europe through charity\ngroups. The United States has long called Hezbollah a terrorist\norganization, but the French, American and European officials said, have\nopposed doing so, and argue that making such a designation now would be\nunwise, given the new turbulence in Lebanon. Israeli and American\nofficials say that the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has told\nthem that he, too, regards Hezbollah as a destructive force in the\nMiddle East, one determined to undermine peace talks by supporting\nmilitant groups that attack Israelis. Gotta love that. The Palestinian\npresident admits that Hezbollah are a bunch of f-wad terrorists but the\nFrench don't agree....No joke.\u3002\nThe Europeans are not solidly opposed to listing Hezbollah as a\nterrorist group, the officials said. The Netherlands, Italy and Poland\nsupport the Bush administration's view, several officials said, while\nGermany and Britain believe the issue is moot unless the French change\ntheir minds. One European diplomat said other countries were \"hiding\nbehind\" France on the issue.\u3002\n...\u3002\nA European diplomat said the issue of calling Hezbollah a terrorist\norganization was discussed in Brussels on Wednesday at a meeting of the\nClearing House, a unit of the European Union that meets in confidential\nsessions to review terrorist activities in Europe. The group could reach\nno consensus, the diplomat said. \"Nothing is going to change on\nHezbollah because we don't have an agreement among the member states,\"\nthe diplomat said. \"That doesn't mean we won't get a consensus. I know\nthe Americans are impatient, but the European Union has 25 states, and\nthese things take time.\" Some of those interviewed tried to make it\nsound as if the reason they are hesitant to go along with Bush is\nbecause of the situation in Lebanon. But as The Captain points out, it\nprobably has more to do with Iran:\u3002\nI suspect the true reason for the reluctance comes not from the\n\"delicate\" nature of Lebanese politics, but from the relationship\nbetween Hezbollah and the Iranians. The EU has tried for the past two\nyears to appease the Iranian mullahs into giving up their\nnuclear-weapons ambitions to little avail. They don't want to rock the\nboat now by attempting to starve out the mullahs' terror agent that\nconducts the proxy attacks against Israel that Iran cannot afford to do\nitself openly. They did not learn from Hitler's Germany I guess, they\ntried to appease that guy too.\u3002\nThis whole thing just reminds me how corrupt and useless France is.\nThey will forever be known as that corrupt and cowards in my opinion.\u3002\nRead From On High , Dhimmi Watch , Cranky Neocon , and My View Of The\nWorld for more.\u3002\n\n\n\n\n",
