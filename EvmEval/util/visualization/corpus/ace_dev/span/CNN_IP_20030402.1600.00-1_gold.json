As of an hour or so ago, we got word from\nthe battlefield that U.S. forces were just 15 miles away from the\nsouthern edge of Baghdad. And they may be even closer right now. The\ntoughest fight, though, may lie ahead in the heart of the Iraqi capital.\nPentagon sources say the first phase of the final push into Baghdad is\nnow under way. U.S.-led forces were able to press farther north after\ndefeating Iraqi Republican Guard units at Karbala and Kut (ph). Our\nembedded reporters say the two-pronged advance appears to be moving\nfaster than commanders expected. The Pentagon says two of the Republican\nGuard divisions defending Baghdad are no longer credible forces. Scenes\nfrom Najaf may also be bolstering the troops' spirit. Iraqis who\ninitially were cautious when U.S. forces arrived in Najaf ended cheering\nthem on, shaking their hands and patting their backs. U.S. Army's 7th\nCavalry is in the forefront of U.S. troops since they first left Kuwait\nand crossed directly into the Iraqi desert. Our Walter Rodgers is\nembedded with the unit's 3rd Squadron, which is leading the 3rd Infantry\nDivision's march toward the Iraqi capital.\u3002\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u3002\n                                   \nThroughout the day, as the U.S. Army 7th Cavalry punched northward in the\ngeneral direction of Baghdad, we have seen huge convoys of supply troops\nmoving ever northward. Indeed, all the arrows on the Army's map seem to\nbe pointing in the direction of the southern suburbs of Baghdad. Earlier\nin the day, the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division took Karbala\nwith a minimum of fight. And then the 3rd Brigade of the 3rd Infantry\nDivision secured the town of Karbala. Additionally, the 7th Cavalry has\npushed onward in the general direction of Baghdad. Yesterday we were\nabout 50 miles from the southern suburbs of Baghdad. We have perhaps have\nthat distance. Throughout the day, we have watched the 3rd Infantry\nDivision bring in prisoners of war. Iraqi soldiers glad the war is over\nfor them, perhaps 100 at a time. There were times when the 7th Cavalry\nitself got into some skirmishes as it pushed forward, again in the\ndirection of Baghdad. There was a bit of a firefight when the 7th Cavalry\ncame upon three Soviet vintage 20- millimeter anti-aircraft guns, ack-ack\nguns. The Iraqi unit in possession of those guns fired mortars in the\ndirection of the 7th Cavalry. The Apache troop opened its tank guns,\nopened its own mortars, decimated that unit, put it out of existence and\nprobably killed some 20 Iraqis in the process. This as it continues to\npush ever closer towards the southern suburbs of Baghdad. Walter Rodgers,\nCNN, with the U.S. 7th Cavalry in the Iraqi desert.\u3002\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u3002\n         \nAnd it's a similar story from CNN's Karl Penhaul who is now just miles\nfrom the southern outskirts of the Iraqi capital. He's embedded with the\nU.S. Army's 11th Attack Helicopter Regiment. Here's his report just filed\na few minutes ago.\u3002\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u3002\n                                              \nThe speed as they push to Baghdad seems to have gathered pace overnight\nand in the course of this morning. In fact, it's going much faster than\nmany of the U.S. commanders on the ground predicted.\u3002\n\n                           \nThe intensity it's very quick moving, very fluid battle. The armor, and\nmechanized infantry, and artillery pieces and personnel on the ground are\nmoving at rapid speeds.\u3002\n\n         \nOvernight and early this morning, the tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles\nof the 3rd Infantry Division backed by the Apache attack helicopters of\nthe 11th Aviation Regiment punched through the Republican Guard defenses\nin and around Karbala. They were then able to advance far north of that\ncity and, as we speak, U.S. commanders tell me that elements of the 3rd\nInfantry Division are now literally just a few miles from Baghdad.\u3002\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u3002\n\n\n",
