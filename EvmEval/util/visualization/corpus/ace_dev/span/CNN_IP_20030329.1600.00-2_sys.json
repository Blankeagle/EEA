Who looks out for the unlikely prospect of Iraqi\naircraft, and the more likely prospect of Iraqi missiles or artillery.\n(on camera): Does your mindset change across the border into Iraq?\u3002\n\n                   \nNo, because I am in an area which I don't know where the enemy could be\nand I might get to the airplane, by the time I get out of the airplane\nI'm thinking the same way.\u3002\n\n         \nWhich is?\u3002\n\n                   \nThe hair on the back of my neck starts standing up, then something's\ngoing wrong.\u3002\n\n                      \nAs a precaution, the crew starts turning the huge plane in circles to see\nwhat the targets do. Ultimately it's discovered the targets are U.S.\ncombat helicopters. Minutes later the search and rescue helicopter\narrives for its refueling. Watch the flash from our night vision camera\nas the plane's fuel line connects with the chopper. Both aircraft fly at\n125 miles per hour gingerly over enemy land. At times they are only 50\nfeet apart with the chopper's rotor blades getting closer. Looking with\nthe naked eye out of the plane, the helicopter is impossible to see. The\npitch-black maneuver ends after 10 minutes. (on camera): What stops\nthough - we know the Iraqis have fired sand missiles and fired AAA at\naircraft all throughout this war. They haven't hit anybody, but isn't it\nrisky flying so low knowing they have that ammunition to fire at you.\u3002\n\n                   \nAgain, we know where we're going. We know where they're at so we simply\navoid them and if for some reason they do get off a lucky shot or they do\nsee us, we have defensive systems on board the airplane to defeat their\nammunition.\u3002\n\n         \nWe all fly with bulletproof vests in case the plane goes down. We also\nfly with parachutes in case we need to get out before the plane goes\ndown. (voice-over): But three airmen aboard this plane have parachutes\nfor a different reason. They are the Pararescue jumpers, or PJs who jump\noff the plane for rescue missions.\u3002\n\n                   \nI mean it's probably the most - the best feeling in the world knowing\nthat your purpose is really defined at that moment.\u3002\n\n         \nNo rescues were necessary on this sortie. The plane arrived back to base\nsafely. (on camera): Do you have any fear?\u3002\n\n                   \nEverybody has a little bit of fear but I think it's a good thing in this\ncircumstance.\u3002\n\n                      \nThis crew could be back on another mission in as few as 24 hours.\u3002\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u3002\n         \nThis is a very busy base. We want to give you a look right now at the\naircraft coming in for landings. It looks like LAX on a Sunday night and\nthis is what it's been like for the past 11 days. We have just watched\nmultitudes of warplanes land, multitudes of warplanes take off and this\nmay be the busiest night of the campaign. They're expecting a total at\nthis particular base near the Iraqi border of 300 sorties in a 24-hour\nperiod ending today according to the Air Force total from all the bases\nand there are more than 30 bases in 12 different countries in the Middle\nEast according to the Pentagon. They're saying there will be 1500 sorties\nin a 24-hour period ending tomorrow. Eight hundred of those sorties will\nbe strike sorties using bombs and missiles so there is no slow down in\nthe amount of air power being used over Iraq. Wolf, back to you.\u3002\n\n         \nThat's a lot of bombs and missiles. Gary Tuchman in an air base near the\nIraq border, thanks very much, Gary Tuchman. This programming note,\ntomorrow at noon Eastern I'll have a special interview with the nation's\ntop military officer, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General\nRichard Myers will be my special guest on a special late addition. That's\nat noon Eastern, nine A.M. Pacific tomorrow. That's Sunday and I'll be\nback Judy and at the top of the hour for Wolf Blitzer Reports. We'll have\na complete wrap of all the day's late breaking developments. In the\nmeantime, back to Judy Woodruff in Washington.\u3002\n\n          \nWe'll be watching you both times at the top of the hour and certainly for\nlate edition on Sunday. Thanks Wolf. Well, as coalition forces push\nnorth, they are encountering a unique problem of combat, getting rid of\nthe weapons captured from the enemy. Some of the 40,000 British troops\nare kicking up a lot of dust in the Iraqi desert making sure that nothing\nis left behind them that could hurt them. Greg Milam is with the U.K.\nforces in southern Iraq.\u3002\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\u3002\n                               \nSeemingly deserted, these battered buildings hold a deadly threat to\nBritish forces in Iraq.\u3002\n\n                                        \nThis is what we're coming across a lot of these, 30 mil, 60 mil, 80 mil,\neven 120 mil. So there's plenty still out there that will have to be\nrecovered because they can be used.\u3002\n\n       \nDo you know when this place was last used? I mean do you know\n(UNINTELLIGIBLE)\u3002\n\n        \nI'm not too sure but judging by some of this, it's been here quite a long\ntime so whether it's been used recently by them - there was an Intel\nupbeat saying that they were possibly coming back to try and get this to\nuse against them.\u3002\n\n       \nGrenades, mortars, all sorts of ammunition abandoned by Iraqi soldiers\nbut there for the taking. The job of these Royal Engineers is to clear\nthis and many other mountains of armaments and destroy them. Some are too\nunstable to be moved and have to be blown up on the spot. The rest is\ncarried way out into the desert. And today's parts in this conflict, this\nkind of work becomes more and more important. With the coalition forces\nmoving forward the last thing they want is weaponry like this lurking\nbehind them.\u3002\n\n                                     \nWith the amounts of ammunition and weapons left about, if they'd used\nthose systems, that amount of weapon it would have given us a\nconsiderable amount of trouble trying to take the positions.\u3002\n\n       \nWith much of this weaponry there is only one safe thing to do. No one in\nthe British forces here is willing to take any risks. Greg Milam, Sky\nNews, Southern Iraq.\u3002\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\u3002\n\n\n",
