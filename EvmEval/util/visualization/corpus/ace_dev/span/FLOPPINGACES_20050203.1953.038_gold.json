It\nseems a supposed straight shooting reporter with NBC was taking money to\nfund a book that is so pro-united nations that its almost sickening to\nread. (hat tip Clear and Present )\u3002\nOne of the hottest stories around, the U.N. corruption scandal, NBC\nhas been out to lunch. Why? Its U.N. reporter has been on the payroll of\nthe U.N. lobby. Linda Fasulo, the U.N. correspondent for NBC News and\nMSNBC, has written a pro-U.N. book, An Insider's Guide to the U.N. ,\nwhich reads like the U.N. paid for it. Actually, the pro-U.N. lobby paid\nfor it. In a monstrous conflict of interest for a supposed straight news\nreporter, Fasulo acknowledges Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation and Better\nWorld Campaign for \"their generous financial support\" of her book\nproject. She also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund \"for helping to\nfund the project.\" The book is about \"one of the finest and most\nimportant governing bodies,\" she says. Of the U.N. chief, she writes\nlike a school girl with a crush. \"It is hard to find anyone who can\nmount a serious criticism of [Kofi] Annan's performance as Secretary\nGeneral,\" she claims. His performance is so \"impressive\" that she\nwonders if a \"cult of personality\" has risen up around him. One U.S.\nofficial is reported to be \"astonished by just how good a Secretary\nGeneral Kofi Annan has been.\" Yup, you read that right. Kofi's\nperformance is soooooo impressive. Gag. Guess the democrats have their\nown Armstrong conspiracy to deal with.\u3002\nWhy would an NBC reporter (who also reports on the U.N. for National\nPublic Radio) take money from the U.N. lobby? Perhaps because longtime\nNBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put his stamp of approval on the UNA-USA and\nBCUN by acting as master of ceremonies at their 2001 Global Leadership\nDinner. Not surprisingly, Brokaw is listed on the Fasulo book jacket as\nsaying it is a \"must-read.\" Another endorsement of the book comes from\nBarbara Crossette, former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who\nnow writes for U.N. Wire, a Ted Turner-funded online news service that\ncovers the U.N. A fascinating part of the book is how Fasulo manages to\ngloss over Annan's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. She tries to\nblame the U.S. and other members of the Security Council for not sending\nenough troops to stop it. She admits, however, that, \"The Rwanda\nmassacres occurred while Annan was U.N. Undersecretary General for\npeacekeeping,\" and that \"After he became SG [Secretary General], Annan\ncommissioned a report to examine what had happened and suggest\nremedies.\" Later, \"Annan accepted responsibility for failing to act more\nquickly,\" she writes. But responsibility for what? The truth is that, as\ndirector of U.N. peacekeeping, Annan personally refused requests to\nauthorize U.N. peacekeepers in Rwanda to seize weapons and prevent\ngenocide. Writer and author Philip Gourevitch has described in detail\nhow, three months before the genocide, Major General Romeo Dallaire, the\ncommander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda, sent a fax to Kofi\nAnnan's office, saying he had received evidence from a Rwandan\ngovernment informant that genocide was being planned. The informant\noffered to help U.N. forces in raiding the government stockpiles to be\nused in the genocide campaign. All that the informant wanted in return\nwas protection for himself and his family. But the general needed U.N.\nauthorization to conduct such a raid and save lives. He asked for that\napproval but the answer came back in a now-infamous \"genocide fax\" from\nAnnan's office. It denied authorization for the mission and told him\nthat he should turn the information provided by the confidential witness\nover to the Rwandan government which was planning the genocide! The\nresult was that the information dried up and the genocide took place.\nYup, good ole Kofi told this poor guy to give the secret info over to\nthe very government that was planning the genocide. What a great guy he\nis isn't he.\u3002\nOr how about the ongoing prostitution that's going on in the Congo?\u3002\nNow the report comes out today on the Oil for Food scandal.\nYeah...this guy is such a good SG. Eff him.\u3002\nThe article ends with the following:\u3002\nIn an April 30, 2001, Washington Times column, Nat Hentoff noted that\nthe media have devoted \"scant mention\" to the \"plain fact that it was\nMr. Annan, when he was head of the United Nation's peacekeeping office,\nwho could have prevented the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and their\nsympathizers in Rwanda in 1994.\" It's true, Hentoff said, that the U.N.\nissued a report in 1999 that acknowledged, to some extent, its role in\nthe killings. But for five and a half years, he noted, Annan \"refused to\naccept any responsibility for the Rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch\nand others revealed that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stopped\nthe killings if Mr. Annan had not closed his eyes.\" It is astonishing\nthat a journalist for NBC New would close her eyes to Annan's role. But\nthat is what she was apparently paid to do.\u3002\n\n\n\n\n",
