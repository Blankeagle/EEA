Immediately after she\ntook office, she found out that the USCF had no money in the bank,\nzero. The USCF did not even have the money to pay the guaranteed\nprizes at the just concluded US Open in Los Angeles.\u3002\nTherefore, on August 20, 2003, bravely Beatriz walked into the USCF\nOffices in New Windsor and immediately fired 17 staff members. John\nMcCrary resigned from the board as a result.\u3002\nOf course, it was just a pure coincidence that the 17 people Beatriz\nfired were the people she had grown to dislike during the year that\nshe worked for the USCF in 1999-2000.\u3002\nIt took six weeks before the USCF paid the guaranteed prizes the prize\nwinners had won at the US Open.\u3002\nI have just found out something that insiders had known for a long\ntime. The USCF did not have zero money in the bank. It had $85,000 in\nanother bank account that nobody knew about. This was not due to any\nmalfeasance. The office accountant for the USCF had set up a separate\nbank account and had put the entry fees from the US Open into that\naccount. Nobody knew about that separate bank account, except for the\naccountant herself.\u3002\nWhen this was discovered, the accountant explained that she was\nplanning to keep the money in that account until the tournament was\nclosed out. Perhaps the accountant was following a procedure followed\nby the USCF for scholastic tournaments. At scholastic tournaments, no\ncash prizes are paid. However, in adult tournaments, the players\nexpect to receive their prizes, and to receive them immediately.\u3002\nFor this act of stupidity which had caused a grave crisis in the USCF,\nthe accountant was immediately fired.\u3002\nHad the existence of this $85,000 in a secret bank account been known,\nit would not have been necessary to fire those 17 people right away.\nPerhaps in the long run it was a good thing to fire them, but it might\nnot have been a good idea to fire them all abruptly, in the same day.\u3002\nSam Sloan\u3002\n\n\n       \n                                 \n Re: Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis \u3002\n    \n\nBullcrap. He was embarassed by how Niro misled him into thinking there would\nbe a surplus. He was asked to wait until after the LA meeting was over\nbefore resigning.\u3002\n    \n\nRight, we shoulda pissed another 85,000 away before we stopped the red ink.\u3002\n\n\n            \n                          \n Re: Turns out the August 2003 crisis was not a crisis \u3002\nFrank Niro thanks Sam Sloan in this message to the FIDE newsgroup:\u3002\n                               \n Frank Niro comments on the Aug 2003 so-called crisis \u3002\nYes, Sam, you are correct. And I knew about it also.\u3002\nI also knew about the $100,000+ of audit adjustments (and non-adjustments) for\ninventory, unbilled advertising, newsstand sales, tournament revenues, pension\n&amp;health insurance over-accruals, multi year membership revenue, etc. etc. that\nI was too sick to argue with Linda and the auditors about. I knew that they\nwould get corrected as a matter of course during fiscal 2004 resulting in\nunderstatement of 2003 income and overstatement of 2004. And, of course, that\nis what happened. I just had no idea that the new Board would see it as\nleverage to seize power and pummel the office staff.\u3002\nNot only was there adequate cash put aside, we had approval for an equity loan\non the building to bridge the move. But I didn't want to pay the $10,000 points\nand interest unless and until it was absolutely necessary. We also had a buyer\nfor the building at a prize much higher than it was eventually sold for and a\ncommitment for 4% bank financing in Crossville.\u3002\nStaff reductions were clearly in the works pending system changes that would be\nfacilitated by any move, Miami, PBG, Crossville or elsewhere. To make the staff\ncuts without the system changes was absurd and probably the reason for McCrary\n&amp;Camaratta's departures.\u3002\nWhen I offered to attend the Board meeting in October 2003 to explain and\nclarify all this, I was told I was not welcome. I sat in New Windsor all\nweekend waiting for a phone call so I could answer EB questions and shed light\non the situation. It is no coincidence that the employees let go included\nsubstantially all those who had offered to transfer to Crossville, including\n(remarkably) the employee of the year!\u3002\nYou can read all this in my book coming out next summer.\u3002\nThanks for seeing the truth for a change.\u3002\nBest wishes to all,\nFrank Niro\u3002\nIn a message dated 12/16/2004 10:55:45 AM Eastern Standard Time,\u3002\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n",
