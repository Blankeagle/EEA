Foreign Minister Prince Saud\nal-Faisal spoke of the \"kingdom's hope for a quick halt in military\naction and for the return to peaceful efforts\", the state SPA news\nagency reported.\u3002\nIn Riyadh's first reaction to the start of the against, he also\ncalled for Iraq's \"unity, internal security and territorial\nintegrity\" to be preserved and rejected military occupation.\u3002\nLebanese President Emile Lahoud, meanwhile, was more forthright,\nstrongly denouncing Washington's \"aggression\" and warning that it\ncould have repercussions beyond the borders of the pariah state.\u3002\n\"We have warned against the marginalisation of the United Nations ...\nand we see this aggression today plunging the world into a tunnel\nwhere one cannot see the end,\" he said in a statement.\u3002\n\"For these reasons, we judge that it is necessary that the forces of\npeace and those who believe in right and justice take the necessary\nand rapid steps to halt this dangerous slide into war against Iraq\nwhich will result in heavy human and material losses.\"\u3002\nThe Palestinian Authority also condemned Thursday's early morning\nmissile strikes on Iraq, and warned Israel not to exploit the\nconflict.\u3002\n\"We Palestinians are against the war and we totally condemn this war\nin the Middle East. A solution must be found to this problem through\ndiplomatic means, with the international community,\" local\nauthorities minister Saeb Erakat said.\u3002\n\"We are warning Israel not to exploit this war against Iraq to carry\nout more attacks against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip and\ndestroy the Palestinian Authority and the peace process,\" he said.\u3002\nThe radical Palestinian movement Islamic Jihad warned that \"the war\nagainst Iraq is a war against the whole region\", while Hamas issued a\nchilling warning against those taking part in the war against Iraq.\u3002\n\"The aggression by the vile Americans and the war against Iraq\nsignifies a war against all Arabs and Muslims around the world,\" said\nHamas senior official Abdul Aziz al-Rantissi.\u3002\nThe war \"shows the impotence of all Arab states. We call on all Arab\nstates to act immediately to defend Iraq and counter the US war,\" he\nsaid.\u3002\n\"I don't think America will win this war, as our jihad (holy war) and\nour resistance will teach the Americans and British a lesson they\nwill never forget,\" he said.\u3002\nState radio in Syria accused the United States and its allies of\nwanting to get their \"hands on Iraq's oil and wealth and impose their\nhegemony on the world\".\u3002\nIn the Egyptian capital, 10 demonstrators and at least four policeman\nwere injured in clashes after several thousand demonstrators took to\nthe streets near the US and British embassies.\u3002\nRiot police intervened after the protestors, who included hundreds of\nstudents from the American University in Cairo, rallied on the city's\ncentral Tahrir Square, close to both the university campus and the US\nembassy.\u3002\nMore than 1,000 people also gathered at Cairo's Al-Azhar Islamic\nUniversity, where they burned an American flag and demanded the\nexpulsion of the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, Spain and\nIsrael.\u3002\nDemonstrations also took place in the northern Egyptian cities of\nAlexandria, Tanta and Kafr el-Sheikh.\u3002\nIn Amman, three protestors were hospitalised after some 500 Jordanian\nlawyers staged a sit-in at the main court house after being forcibly\nblocked by riot police from marching towards the Iraqi embassy to\nshow their solidarity.\u3002\nIn Lebanon, hundreds of students gathered on the campuses of the Arab\nUniversity of Beirut and the American University of Beirut calling\nfor the assassination of US President George W. Bush and British\nPrime Minister Tony Blair.\u3002\nSouth of the capital in Sidon, some 1,500 schoolboys denounced \"the\nBush assassin\" and the \"silence of the Arab leaders who sold out\nIraq\".\u3002\n\n\n",
