These are\nthe same terrorists blowing up families, chopping off heads of\ncivilians, and the complete disregard for any human life and they just\ndisagree with us?\u3002\nTell that to the family of Margaret Hassan, the school teacher who\nwas brutally tortured and then slaughtered by these same guys, they\nain't so bad are they Chris Matthews? This women who was known for her\n30 years of work in Iraq, distributing medicine, food and supplies to\nIraqis suffering under the sanctions of the 1990s.\u3002\nBritish officials say they believe Hassan was a blindfolded woman\nseen being shot in the head by a hooded militant on a video obtained but\nnot aired by the Arab television station Al-Jazeera. She would be the\nfirst foreign woman to die in the wave of kidnappings in Iraq. No group\nhas claimed responsibility.\u3002\nOn Sunday, Marines found the mutilated body of what they believe was\na Western woman on a street in Fallujah during the U.S. assault on the\ninsurgent stronghold. The body, clothed in what appeared to be a purple,\nvelour dress, was wrapped in a blanket, with a blood-soaked black cloth\nnearby. As of Tuesday night, the U.S. command said the body had not been\nidentified.\u3002\nThese are the reasons that none of these mothereffers should ever see\nthe light of day...they need to be all lined up and shot. Torturing this\npoor women for what? WHAT? And we should treat them as enemy soldiers\nunder the Geneva Convention. Last I remember the convention applies to\ncountries that signed the document and the two countries must have\nstanding armies with uniforms....the Iraqi military is at our side, the\nterrorists are not. Since when are terrorists soldiers? They are lower\nthen dogs.\u3002\nFinally there is this written by a student of Mrs. Hassan She was my\nEnglish teacher\u3002\nIn the memory of my teacher and a fellow aid worker colleague Mrs. M.\nHassan\u3002\nMrs. Hassan was my English teacher in The British Council in Baghdad\nin Al-Wazirya district, I remember her years ago with her Irish accent\ntelling me it's not Important how many words I must learn but the\npronunciation of the words I already knew must be perfected.\u3002\nMrs. Hassan speak s perfect Arabic and she has a heart of gold, she's\nbeen killed by (men in pajamas), turn Iraq upside down and find them.\nThe Marines will find them, and when they do they shall die.\u3002\n\n\n\n\n",
