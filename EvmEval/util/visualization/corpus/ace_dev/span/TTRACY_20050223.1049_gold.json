After\nChristmas, I got a call from the wife of one of my former bosses (at my\nlast full-time job). She was looking for a Development Assistant at the\nretirement community where she works. I started here 4 weeks ago. WM is\naffiliated with, but not run or fully supported by, the denomination\nI've been a part of all my life (UMC). My grandmother (who was Baptist)\nlived here for a few months before she died in 1995, so I have many\nconnections to the job. Our offices are in one of the patio homes, and I\nhave my own lovely office with a window. The job's only about 12 miles\nfrom home, and I'm going against the bulk of the traffic mornings and\nafternoons. It all seems perfect and yet... Oh, I'm so thankful to be\nsomewhere so nice where I might actually make a difference in people's\nlives, and I want to keep an open mind and hope it'll last forever, but\nI have a feeling I'll be restless within a year or so. My boss is a very\nnice person, but conservative and resistant to technology, i.e.\ncomputers, internet, etc. We just got new computers a week and half ago,\nand she's griping about XP (her old OS was Windows 98--mine was 95, so\nI'm thrilled with the new stuff). I tell her it'll just take some\ngetting used to. We'll see.\u3002\nI'm not making the kind of salary I was hoping to get, but it's the\nbest salary I've gotten thus far. When I was fulltime in radio I made a\nlittle less, but I got quite a few remotes, which make up for not\ngetting a topnotch salary. I'm still doing my TV announcing and my\nweekend radio stuff, so that money will help. I'm going to start\nactively pursuing more voice work in the next month or so, too. My plan\nis to pay off my car early, and then work on the other debts. I think\nit's time to go on and fill out the adoption applications. I'm terrified\nof more debt, but Mom and Dad will help with the money. I'm not sure\nthey realize how expensive it all is. I'm thinking we might lean toward\nadopting from Guatemala, but we've still not hashed it all out. It's\nalmost bad making some money now, because while most of me wants to save\nas much as possible, the other, smaller part is screaming loudly for\nstuff, stuff, stuff!!! I've got a trial subscription to XM at work\nbecause of the Dell computers, and now I'm lusting to have it all of the\ntime. G got me a nice office stereo for my birthday and it does have an\naux jack, so I could listen to it here. He asked if I wanted a car\nstereo, and I said no, but I do. There are so many things I want. A\ngarage. A dining room set. New stuff for our house. New clothes. New\neverything. But I want family more. I think part of the draw of the\nother stuff is I could get it now. But I'd be paying for it later. Money\nmakes the world go round and round and round til I'm just dizzy.\u3002\n\n\n\n",
