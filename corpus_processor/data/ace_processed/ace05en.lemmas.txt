BEGALA Well , we will debate that later on in the show .
we will have a couple of expert come out , so I will withhold my comment until then .
even as the secretary of homeland security be put he people on high alert last month , a 30-foot cuban patrol boat with four heavily armed man land on american shore , utterly undetected by the Coast Guard Secretary Ridge now lead .
now , why have we president place homeland security in the hand of republican political hack instead of professional , by the way ?
Attorney General John Ashcroft , for example , be a career politician .
he lose a election to a dead man .
Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge be another career politician who be pass over by Mr. Bush for the vice presidency .
and Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Asa Hutchinson be yet another career politician and a graduate of the disgraceful Bob Jones University .
apparently , Mr. Bush only turn to professional when it be really important , like political consulting .
NOVAK Paul , as I understand you definition of a political -- of a professional politician base on that be somebody who be elect to public office .
now in you administration , the Clinton administration , there be these member of the cabinet who by you definition be professional politician -- Lloyd Bentsen , Les Aspin , William S. Cohen , Janet Reno , Bruce Babbitt , Mike Espy , Dan Glickman , Norman Mineta , Henry Cisneros , Federico Pena , Bill Richardson , Richard Riley , 12 of they , not to mention former democratic National Chairman Ron Brown , and one of the great professional politician of all time , Bill Daly .
BEGALA and you know what , they do a hell of a job for we country .
and these bozo let four armed Cubans land on we shore when they be try to make a high terrorist alert .
we president have put homeland security in the hand of failed republican hack .
hire professional , Mr. President .
NOVAK so it be ok -- it be ok to have professional politician at the Justice Department and the Pentagon ... BEGALA Janet Reno be a career prosecutor .
NOVAK just a minute , let I finish my sentence , please .
it be ok to put democratic career politician at the Pentagon and the Justice Department if they be democrat but not if they be Republicans , be that right ?
BEGALA No , the difference be Janet Reno be a career prosecutor .
-lrb- crosstalk -rrb- BEGALA John Ashcroft be not half the woman that Janet Reno be .
NOVAK another potential democratic presidential candidate ponder whether to run , and he make he announcement , and surprise , surprise , the answer be no .
Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut make the announcement today that he would not be the 10th candidate for the nomination .
why not ?
surely Chris Dodd be at least more credible than Carol Moseley-Braun or Dennis Kucinich .
he explain he could better spend the next two year on homeland security , the economy and judicial nomination .
I guess that mean harass Tom Ridge , fight tax cut and obstruct President Bush 's plan to reform judiciary .
some two year .
BEGALA God , I hope so .
that be all I can say .
I love Senator Dodd .
he would have bring a lot to the race .
he bring a lot to the Senate and to the debate .
and I be glad that he be go to be fight those fight .
well , the Commerce Department report today that consumer spending decline in January and that the manufacturing sector slow in February .
in all , two million Americans have lose they job under President Bush so far , not to mention three of they be the top three leader of he economic team .
meanwhile , the deficit now at $ 300 billion .
it could swell to as much as $ 500 billion if we go to war in Iraq .
Mr. Bush apparently be untroubled by this fiscal collapse .
one of he aide tell the current issue of `` TIME , '' magazine , quote , `` even if it be $ 500 billion , so what ? ''
of course , even a $ 500 billion deficit number do not count the $ 3 trillion Mr. Bush be rob from the Social Security trust fund .
you know , we should have know , every time George W. Bush get in trouble , he borrow from a trust fund .
it be be he whole life , you know .
NOVAK let I give you two economic fact of like , which you should know , even if you will not recognize they .
number one , there be absolutely no relationship between the deficit and unemployment .
they do not go together .
and number two , there be no Social Security fund , Virginia .
there just be not one .
BEGALA because Bush squander it on he tax cut .
NOVAK there never have be one .
BEGALA there have be one for 60 year .
NOVAK welcome back .
order go out today to deploy 17,000 U.S. Army soldier in the Persian Gulf region .
the army 's entire first Calvary division base at Fort Hood , Texas , would join the quarter million U.S. force already in the region .
we be talk about possibility of full scale war with former Congressman Tom Andrews , Democrat of Maine .
he be now national director of Win without War , and former congressman Bob Dornan , Republican of California .
BEGALA Bob , one of the reason I think so many Americans be worry about this war and so many people around the world do not want to go be there have be a lot of problem with credibility from this administration .
we president have repeatedly , for example , rely on a man whom you be aware , Hussein Kamel , Saddam Hussein 's son-in-law , leader of the Iraq arm program who defect for a time .
and give we a whole lot of information and then go home and he father-in-law kill he .
bad move .
but while he be here , he give we a whole lot of information .
give we a whole lot of information .
well , we president tell we that information prove that the dictator have chemical weapon , which be true .
but what we just learn this week from `` Newsweek '' magazine which get a hold of the debriefing , be that he also tell we it be destroy back in 1995 .
why have not we president tell we that ?
why do we have to learn it from `` Newsweek '' ?
DORNAN I do not believe that he believe it be all destroy .
the fact that this guy be such a idiot to go back and let he father-in-law kill he show he be not the most stable of people .
but the thing that ... BEGALA Good point .
but should not we president have tell we what the CIA tell he .
why do we learn from `` Newsweek ?
`` should he level with we ?
DORNAN Paul , look , the problem be I would stipulate all four of we hate war .
any rational person hate war .
Bush be not sit in that White House not think about the body bags come home with great young man .
Clinton suffer greatly over the 19 Rangers that die , 18 on the 3rd of October and Matt Reersen -lrb- ph -rrb- three day later .
I visit all they family .
I be at the medal of honor ceremony for the kid .
let I tell you , what trip to Walter Reed teach I be , that whoever think up the term , the law of unintended consequence it pertain to war .
I be shake over the aftermath .
but , this guy be a monster , a mini-me Hitler .
he will blow a city off the earth in a minute if he can get the hold of the means to do it .
NOVAK Tom Andrews , I think we all realize that a government do not go to war a nation go to war .
and so I would like you to take a look at the CNN / `` USA TODAY '' / Gallup poll , take last week , should U.S. troops to go to Iraq to remove Saddam Hussein from power .
take a look at it .
favor 59 % , oppose 37 % , that be a vastly larger support than President Bush Senior have in get the U.S. troops out of Kuwait before that war start .
that be pretty good support be not it ?
ANDREWS now , Bob , come on you do not really buy this .
I mean , listen , this be the oldest trick in the book .
you can have a general question like this that could mean anything and ask people and they give you what come off the top of they head .
but , ask they another question , ask they what they think about spend $ 1.3 trillion in destroy this economy .
ask they about go and not just a war , Bob , but a invasion and occupy for up to 10 year a sovereign Arab nation in the midst of one of the most distable and volatile region in the world .
ask they how they feel about get bog down .
well , I have see some of the figure .
once you start tell Americans the story , -- the administration refuse today tell we story .
they be not come forward and tell we what the risk be , what the cost be , how many year we might be in , the possibility of we get bog down , because what Americans know that , they be oppose to this war .
the more they learn about this invasion , the more they learn about this occupation , the less they support it .
DORNAN Tom , you know what liberal want .
they do not want a smoking gun , they want a smoking city .
the Clinton people all say ... BEGALA that be go to have to be last war , unfair and unfortunate as that be , I be sorry , they be tell we we be out of time .
former congressman , Bob Dornan from California ... DORNAN you be not go to get a smoking city .
NOVAK Former Arkansas Governor and U.S. Senator Dale Bumpers have just publish a memoir call `` the best Lawyer in a One-Lawyer Town . ''
and it span he life from the depression era to the Clinton era .
let 's ask he which be more depressing .
BEGALA First , thank you for write this book .
it be extraordinary .
it be wonderful .
and then we read you one passage .
you cite a session you have with President Lyndon Johnson in Austin , I guess , at he ranch , right ?
here be what you quote we President Johnson to you .
`` when I be majority leader , and later president , I spend all my time pull every power string I could find to pull , try to pass bill that help people .
that make they life better and the country stronger .
that be what the Democrats stand for . ''
`` republican ?
Republicans just stand for two thing : protect the rich and investigation democrat . ''
that be true , though , be not it ?
Johnson be right , be not he ?
bumper i think that be one of the most prescient thing I ever hear , and that be long before white water .
BEGALA Yes .
he never hear of Ken Starr , but he anticipate it .
BUMPERS nothing ever change , Paul .
NOVAK can I interrupt this democratic picnic for just a minute ?
you know , Senator , inadvertently , you give support in this book to one of my pet political theme , which you probably do not agree with .
on page 256 you say , `` as the year go by '' -- this be when you be in the Senate -- `` less and less information be new , fewer and fewer argument be fresh , and the repetitiveness of the old argument become tiresome . ''
`` I be become almost as cynical as my constituent .
I know it be time to leave . ''
be not that a great argument for term limit ?
I know very few senator or any who be as good in they third term as they be in they first term .
should not we limit they to two term ?
BUMPERS First of all , that statement be not design to cover everybody in the United States Senate .
but I must say , that be a pretty accurate statement .
but it have nothing do with term limit , in my opinion .
I think term limit be the worst idea I ever hear of .
-lrb- applause -rrb- begala amen .
novak I try at least .
BEGALA let I turn one more page , to page 257 , actually , right next door to where Bob be read .
this strike I because you have get the courage to say something that be heretical today and it be music to my ear .
you say , `` partisanship have take on a odious connotation , and it may indeed be shriller now than ever .
but we should not lose sight of the fact that we have two political party so people will have choice .
if everybody agree on everything , it might be a tranquil society , but it surely would be a dole one , and certainly not certainly a good one . ''
BUMPERS you know , Paul , that be the reason we have two party , so people have a choice .
and I have say many time , if we all agree on everything , everybody would want to marry Betty and we would really be in a mess , would not we , Bob ?
NOVAK Senator Bumpers , of the 22 senator of the old confederacy , when I get to Washington with the Associated Press , 45 year ago , 22 of they be Democrats , nine be Republicans .
now 13 be Republicans and nine be Democrats .
and of the Democrats , I do not think there be a real liberal .
you last year in the Senate I have a interview with you and I write a column call `` the last Southern Liberal . ''
BUMPERS and I thank you .
it be a very flattering article , Bob .
NOVAK and you say , I will quote it , you say , today 's Southern voter be `` child of Democrats who be not sway by the same thing they mother and father be .
they certainly be susceptible to the republican message . ''
that be a good future for the Democratic Party in the South .
BUMPERS Bob , I think that the reason everybody in the south -- you know , first of all , we be -- when Franklin Roosevelt be elect president , we have be live what we think be still a conquered nation after the civil war .
and we feel that Franklin Roosevelt be the first person who ever really acknowledge that the South have peculiar problem .
and from that time on , that be the reason we have 22 democratic senator from 11 confederate state , be because of the civil war and because of what we think be a heavy hand of the federal government all the time .
of course there be always that old story about the Yankees , and Yankees be synonymous with Republicans .
but that be all change and memory have dim .
and people , you know , they do not remember that .
and so the message , the Republicans have actually have a golden opportunity to make they case and they have do it successfully .
and the Democrats need desperately to get a message to counter that , and they need to get a message and stay on it .
I mean we can not be all over the lot .
-lrb- crosstalk -rrb- novak -lrb- unintelligible -rrb- they be just not buy the new deal anymore in the South .
be not that the truth ?
BUMPERS Well , that be true .
they be not buy a new deal .
but I will tell you the message the Democrats ought to be -- that every time we get sort of within the grasp of the golden age , I mean within reach of the golden age , where everybody have health care , where everybody get a good education -- you know I be one of the million and a half people -- my brother go to Harvard , I go to Northwestern University .
two school my father could not have even think about afford .
a million and a half veteran come out of War World II on the gi bill and get that kind of a education .
if that make I a liberal , because I believe the government have a role to play in that , then I be a certified liberal , because I think that make the country stronger .
I think certainly it make every one of those people stronger , and I think we ought to be do it right now .
no child in this country ought to be deprive of a education for lack of money .
no elderly person ought to have to make a choice between food and medicine .
and they do it by the million every day .
and now ... -lrb- applause -rrb- BEGALA Will you run for president ?
I will chair a committee .
Dale Bumpers for president , lady and gentleman .
thank you very much .
BUMPERS thank you , Paul .
BEGALA that be just terrific .
the book again be Dale Bumpers , `` the best Lawyer in a One-Lawyer Town . ''
I highly recommend it .
and next in we `` fireback '' segment , one of we viewer have a question about we president 's concept of democracy .
Stay tune .
-lrb- applause -rrb-
NOVAK Time for `` Fireback , '' when the viewer fire back at we .
Joshua Hosford of Newport Beach , California -- that would be nice in this weather -- `` Paul , I guess we be go after all .
case in point , Khalid Shaikh Mohammed .
it be amazing how someone can actually do two thing at once .
I be chew gum and talk on the phone while write this note . ''
Joshua , you could not have say anything better .
in fact , I have already say it .
BEGALA Well , in fact , we ally get Mr. Mohammed along with we .
we need ally .
and Bush be so far angered every ally we have .
Dan Snyder of Baden , Pennsylvania write , `` Bush should torture the al Qaeda chief operation officer .
Bush have be torture Americans for two year .
why should this guy get preferential treatment ? ''
-lrb- laughter -rrb- NOVAK and I think he be -- I think he be busy run the Redskins .
no ?
ok .
the next comment be from Frank Mastro of New York City .
`` Mr. Novak , I do not understand the problem .
if the budget go through as be , why do not Mr. Begala and Mr. Carville just donate the extra tax money they do not want ? ''
I say that to all the rich millionaire Democrats , like Carville and Begala , who do not want tax cut .
pay it anyway .
BEGALA I will donate to the Democrats .
they will defeat Bush and everybody will get rich .
that be a better strategy .
David Horn of Long Island , New York , write , `` how can Bush say he be for democracy ?
he have to sue to become we president , and he keep try to bribe other country ' democratic government into he support he agenda .
where do he learn to govern , 1930 's Chicago ? ''
NOVAK ok .
question from the audience .
unidentified male hi .
I be Paul Avalar -lrb- ph -rrb- from Tempe , Arizona .
I have a question also about Khalid Shaikh Mohammed .
and now how be people go to argue that the U.S. can no longer both fight a war with Iraq and also fight terrorism , specifically al Qaeda ?
NOVAK that be a great question .
it be a unanswerable point .
he have not be able to answer it .
and Tom Andrews -lrb- ph -rrb- be not able to answer it .
BEGALA look , we need ally to catch these guy .
we get he because the Pakistanis get he .
we do not get he .
we go to war in Iraq , 200,000 people start protest in Pakistan , they put too much pressure on the government .
it become impossible for those government to cooperate with we like they be cooperate now .
we go to war in Iraq , it would be the worst thing we can do ... NOVAK you know the one thing the Democrats can not stand be good news .
it be just something you can not handle .
BEGALA No .
what I can not stand be a president who be go to screw up we war against terrorism when I think that be he job .
from the left , I be Paul Begala .
good night for crossfire .
NOVAK from the right , I be Robert Novak .
join we again next time for another edition of crossfire .
BEGALA welcome back to crossfire .
President Bush today renew he call for a $ 250,000 cap on pain and suffer damages from the victim of medical malpractice .
ironically down in North Carolina today be also the day funeral service be hold for 17-year-old Jesica Santillan , the brave young woman who get the wrong heart and lung in a botched transplant operation last month .
be she family 's pain and suffer only worth $ 250,000 ?
here to debate medical malpractice reform be consumer advocate Ralph Nader and Dr. Donald Palmisano , the president-elect of the American Medical Association .
-lrb- crosstalk -rrb- NOVAK Ralph Nader , there be state in crisis that keep add to the list by the AMA where doctor be go out of business because they can not afford the medical malpractice rate .
we will just run a scroll of some of the state .
they be big state .
Florida , New Jersey , New York , Ohio , Pennsylvania , Illinois , Texas .
this be a real crisis that lawyer have perpetrate on America , be not it ?
RALPH NADER , consumer advocate another one of you lead question .
this be a medical malpractice crisis .
over 80,000 Americans , 220 every day die from medical negligence , hundred of thousand be injure .
and the insurance company which have relatively steady rate on doctor for about 10 year have find its investment income , its interest income , the stock market collapse down .
and so they be jack up the rate on a few key specialty like obstetrician and neurosurgeon .
but if you take the entire amount of premium , Bob , that be pay by doctor in this country to malpractice insurer and divide it evenly , they would be pay less than $ 9,000 each .
that be one-third of what they pay a receptionist .
NOVAK that run against the fact that so many of they be just leave they practice because they can not afford it .
you know , Ralph , you and I often agree on some thing and one thing I think we agree on be the dirty effect of money and politics .
can you say that the lawyer , the trial lawyer who appoint million and million of dollar into democratic coffer in order to keep this , do you believe that this be healthy ... NADER Well , as much as they have pour into those coffer , it be much less than what the doctor , the malpractice insurer , the hospital chain and the hmo and the nursing home chain have pour into member of Congress ' coffer .
this be first and foremost , Bob , a question of equity .
be we go to allow severely injured people who have find a lung take out that be the wrong lung or a double mastectomy that be not indicate that be inflict on a woman in the Midwest , or that organ transplant that be incompatible on that 17-year-old teenager in North Carolina .
be we go to say to these and so many other , you can not have you full day in court ?
the Congress be go to handcuff the judge and jury in the United States at the state court level ?
I have not yet meet one senator or representative who be for this bill who have demonstrate that the juror in they home state and the judge in they home state be incompetent , unwilling or unable to perform justice in these medical malpractice case .
and I have never hear one person say that the insurance executive who make $ 250,000 a week , every week without any pain and suffering , no one be say cap those .
-lrb- applause -rrb- BEGALA Dr. Palmisano , first thank you for be here .
DR. DONALD PALMISANO , PRESIDENT-ELECT , AMA thank you .
pleasure to be here .
BEGALA there be a hear on Capitol Hill today .
and , I want to ask you to respond to one of the witness , John McCormick testify today .
he be the father of a little girl , 13-month-old girl , who he say today die because of medical malpractice .
he say that the hospital ignore abnormal co2 level in she blood .
Said that the attend physician have sleep through several page .
she die await surgery .
listen to what Mr. McCormick say and I will ask you to respond .
-lrb- BEGIN video clip -rrb- JOHN MCCORMICK , FATHER of MALPRACTICE VICTIM Mr. President , from father to father , my family 's pain and suffering be not frivolous .
-lrb- end video clip -rrb- BEGALA be not he right ?
be not we president wrong to be -- do he win the Lottery ?
you know , Mr. Bush -- President Bush say these guy have win the litigation Lottery .
do that look like a Lottery winner to you , hold a picture of he dead baby ?
PALMISANO Well , the current medical liability system be affect patient in that they can not get access to care .
the American Medical Association work very hard to make safety a priority in the medical care system .
that be why we found the National Patient Safety Foundation .
the current system do not measure negligence .
it measure disability .
and what we be find now be that the emergency room be close , trauma center be close , pregnant woman can not find a doctor to deliver the baby , a boy knock unconscious have to be transport to another state .
another witness today tell of what happen to she husband because there be no longer neurosurgeon available in the community .
the patient have to be airavack and by that time it be too late to prevent the brain damage .
BEGALA those be important point , I do not doubt .
PALMISANO Yes .
BEGALA but I wonder if you can respond to Mr. McCormick 's point .
who be you , who be we president to tell he that he suffering be only worth $ 250,000 for the loss of a child ?
PALMISANO Well , what have to be do here be balance .
what we need be a system that be fair to everyone , a system that keep the physician in practice and allow patient to have access to physician in they hour of need .
and the system in California that be in the bill , in Congress now , hr-5 , that be a system that have work .
it bring stability to California and obstetrician in California will pay 55 , 57 , $ 60,000 in Los Angeles and in South Florida in Miami , they will pay $ 210,000 ... -lrb- crosstalk -rrb- NADER because in California they have regulate the insurance company premium level .
and in Florida , they have be very weak on it .
and in some state , for example , there be doctor that be -- you know , there be 45 payout in ten year and they be not discipline by the state medical board .
I mean , you have get 5 percent of the doctor account for over 55 percent of the payoff , Paul .
in other word a small percentage of doctor that be bad , incompetent , indifferent , whatever .
they be not perform properly and the AMA be not crack down , be not support expansion to state licensing ... -lrb- crosstalk -rrb- palmisano I want to respond to that .
the National Practitioner Data Bank be the source of the information and it be bring up today .
First of all , the Government Accounting Office criticize the methodology use .
it list multiple claim against one physician when actually it be really one claim , different insurer pay on the same physician and it be count as one claim .
it do not mention whether they be obstetrician , neurosurgeon or emergency medicine .
it do not list that .
right now in South Florida , in South Florida , the latest poll show that every neurosurgeon have be sue .
the average number of suit against a neurosurgeon be five in South Florida .
now be these bad doctor ?
we will have no doctor , we will have no neurosurgeon , no obstetrician ... NOVAK we have get to take a break .
NADER maybe they be bad doctor .
NOVAK welcome back .
both the AMA and the Bush administration release report this week say out of control trial lawyer be drive doctor out of they practice all across the country .
President Bush point this way today , even the most frivolous of lawsuit cost money , premium go up and either way , the patient pay .
we be debate malpractice reform with consumer advocate Ralph Nader , and AMA President-Elect Dr. Ronald Palmisano .
BEGALA Dr. Palmisano , again , thanks for stay with we through the break .
let I set aside the hypocrisy of a man who become president because of a lawsuit try to eliminate everybody else 's lawsuit , but instead focus on he own experience .
he be the governor of my state of Texas , where there be a whole lot of doctor .
it turn out that he do not do any kind of a job police you profession at all when he be the governor of Texas .
here be what the `` Dallas morning news '' report recently : `` the Texas State Board of Medical examiner , the agency that pledge to protect the public have grant second and third chance to surgeon who be throw out of hospital because they botch operation .
it have forgive physician who overlook cancerous tumor , who maim infant or whose mistake leave woman sterilize .
it have refuse in the last five year to revoke the license of a single doctor for commit medical error .
thousand more may have be ignore over the last decade . ''
that be the Bush record in police surgeon , why should we trust he now ?
PALMISANO Well , first off ... BEGALA Physicians generally , not just surgeon , forgive I .
PALMISANO Sure .
what we need to do be to make sure that state board , number one , have adequate funding .
the AMA support that .
if there be any bad doctor we want they remove from the practice of medicine .
but it be also ... -lrb- crosstalk -rrb- begala ... bad doctor ?
PALMISANO Well , it be also unfair to make a judgment without know all of the fact of the case .
because someone pay money in a case , the insurance company may pay money because they be afraid there be be go to be a giant award in this case because of this broken liability system .
Troy Brennan -lrb- ph -rrb- of Harvard say there be no correlation with negligence , only with disability .
so let 's look at all of the fact , but give everybody due process here in America before we criticize .
NADER actually , Troy Brennan , the same doctor at Harvard Public School of Health say the issue be not to fuel lawsuit , it be too many .
less than 10 percent of the victim of medical malpractice , and we be talk about horrific injury here , even file a claim .
even file a claim .
and the entire pay-out to all of the victim that get a little money , not the 90 percent who never file a claim , amount to less than what we spend on dog food .
on dog food .
it be about $ 5.4 billion be the pay-out .
that be a fraction of physician income .
it be a fraction of the health care expense of 1.4 trillion .
PALMISANO what we have to do be look at all the fact and have balance here .
that be what the people in Congress have to do .
they have to make sure that whatever they decide keep doctor in practice and patient have access to care .
NADER doctor be go ... PALMISANO but let I - but let I - wait ... NADER doctor be leave practice because of insurance premium , right ?
be that right ?
they do not abandon they patient , except for the high premium of a few specialty ?
PALMISANO because of the premium .
but first of all let I ... NADER why do not you crack down on the insurance company ?
PALMISANO No .
let 's talk about the fact .
let 's talk about the fact .
NADER that be the fact .
PALMISANO -lrb- UNINTELLIGIBLE -rrb- percent of the doctor be insure by physician-owned insurance company , the medical side .
I be just in Oklahoma , they own this insurance company .
they be try to do they very best .
it be a company not for profit .
what happen here be that more money be be pay out than come in .
and as far as the investment income , A.M. Bests -lrb- ph -rrb- show that in the past five year , the investment income have be stable at around 5 percent .
Brown Brothers Harriman say that investment do not precipitate the current crisis .
-lrb- crosstalk -rrb- nader ... payoff have be stable , adjust for inflation , National Practitioners Databank -lrb- ph -rrb- .
why do you want that to be secret ?
all of the information about bad doctor in the National Practitioner bank , you , the AMA want to keep it secret from other doctor and other patient around the country who want to know whether they doctor be on that list .
NOVAK Well , let 's look at what the president be actually propose for people who have be harm by a bad doctor .
let 's listen to what he say to the AMA today .
-lrb- BEGIN video clip -rrb- BUSH if harm by a doc , they ought to be able to recover they economic cost , economic loss .
they should be able to recover non - economic damages as well .
but for the sake of the system , non - economic damages should be cap at $ 250,000 .
-lrb- end video clip -rrb- NOVAK what in the world be wrong with that ?
tell I what be wrong with that ?
NADER what be wrong ?
tell someone who have a double mastectomy , tell a infant who be brain-damaged and have no economic loss that for the rest of they life they be go to get dribble out $ 250,000 for they entire life expectancy ?
wait a minute .
the head of AIG a few year ago be make $ 250,000 every week .
NOVAK two hundred and fifty thousand dollar be a lot of money , though .
not for you , but for most people it be a lot of money .
-lrb- crosstalk -rrb- NADER these executive , why do not you tell ... PALMISANO In California - wait , Mr. Nader .
in California ... NADER why do not you cap insurance ... BEGALA Mr. Palmisano , go ahead .
PALMISANO give I a moment , please .
NADER Go ahead , go ahead .
PALMISANO In California where they have this law , it cap the non-economics , the one you can not quantify .
there be award in 10 million , 20 million , $ 30 million in California for economic .
so all medical , all rehabilitation , care service in the home , lose wages ... NOVAK No , no , no .
I have get to ask Mr. Nader , we be almost out of time .
Doug Friedman -lrb- ph -rrb- , who run Jesse Ventura 's campaign for governor four year ago , say he want you to run for president again .
I know you be say it be much too early to run for president .
but one simple question , Ralph , will you consider another run for president ?
NADER much too early to consider .
I be concern about Donald Zook -lrb- ph -rrb- , who be head of a medical malpractice insurance company , a big one in the West , say that he insurance company executive colleague should not blame the tort injury system .
he say that you problem of jack up these insurance rate be self-inflicted .

NADER wait .

PALMISANO we definitely want to crack down on bad doctor .
but ... -lrb- crosstalk -rrb- NADER do you want to control insurance rate ?
PALMISANO we want the free market to dictate what be do .
BEGALA The free market actually dictate we have get to sell some commercial here on CNN or we be all out of ... PALMISANO thanks .
privilege to be here .
BEGALA welcome back to crossfire .
over in Iraq , arm inspector be discover and destroy missile .
spy plane be search for more ban arm , and iraqi scientist be be interview by U.N. weapon inspector .
but here in Washington , President Bush say it be all a hoax , and many believe he have already make up he mind to go to war .
back with we to talk about it , two congressman : J.D. Hayworth , the Republican from Arizona , and Bernie Sanders , a Independent from Vermont .
NOVAK Congressman Sanders , you be oppose to this war .
I be not crazy about it myself .
but I want to ask you a question .
when the gun begin to fire , when the american man and woman be in harm 's way and may be die , be that now the time for you and you ally to shut up and support the troops ?
-lrb- applause -rrb- SANDERS well it be not -- be you suggest that when ten and thousand of iraqi woman and child be kill , and when young man and woman in this country be unnecessarily put at harm 's risk , what should we do ?
the answer be , these be my neighbor from Vermont and obviously we be go to support they .
and obviously we be go to pray that there be fewer casualty ... NOVAK be you go to demonstrate against they in the street ?
SANDERS No , I do not demonstrate against anybody during a war .
but let 's be clear .
the president almost unilaterally be put we in this position against world opinion .
NOVAK do not the Congress support it ?
I think you vote for it .
SANDERS I do not vote for it .
novak I mean the Congress .
the majority rule .
SANDERS Yes .
the Congress give he authority , but the american people disagree with the decision .
NOVAK not accord to the poll .
SANDERS not the poll that I have see .
BEGALA Congressman Hayworth , back to a comment .
and I know that you mean it and I agree with it .
you say , `` this be Saddam Hussein , the butcher of Baghdad . ''
I be curious , would that have accurately describe he in 1988 ?
HAYWORTH oh , yes .
I think it do .
I think it have describe he , especially since he be take basically a one-man rule over with the Baath Party in 1979 .
BEGALA I agree .
therefore , be not Dick Cheney , as the ceo of Halliburton , wrong to be sell oilfield equipment to the butcher of Baghdad in 1988 ?
HAYWORTH I do not know about any oil equipment go to Saddam Hussein .
what I do know in the here and now be ... BEGALA I can tell you about it if you like .
HAYWORTH that be fine .
and I know you would love to cloud the issue .
BEGALA that be a important issue to I .
HAYWORTH No , it be so important -- you know this -- and I know it be fun and we love do partisan Punch & Judy , but be there ever a time when we stand up even if we respectfully disagree with the commander in chief and those who would wage war ?
dissent be fine , but these cheap shot , I do not know anything about Halliburton .
BEGALA he have $ 73 million worth of -lrb- unintelligible -rrb- to sell oilfield equipment to Saddam Hussein .
-lrb- crosstalk -rrb- HAYWORTH what I do know be Saddam Hussein have butcher over a million of he own citizen .
and to somehow try to play partisan parlor game may be cute , but we be deal with a clear and present danger .
BEGALA would you have treat he as a customer , the way Dick Cheney do ?
HAYWORTH I do not even know about that .
BEGALA would you have sell oilfield equipment to he ?
-lrb- crosstalk -rrb- SANDERS furthermore , the United States support he in the war against Iran .
HAYWORTH Yes .
hello ?
Iran have hostage .
seventy-nine Americans be hold hostage .
SANDERS hello ?
hello ?
we be talk ... -lrb- crosstalk -rrb- SANDERS what we be talk about be the unpredictable nature of war and what could happen in this war .
for example -- wait a second -- in Iran , the reason that you have Ayatollah Khomeini in power be he overthrow the Shah .
you who put the Shah in power ?
the United States of America .
HAYWORTH oh the evil United States .
SANDERS but the point be ... NOVAK I want to get to that point .
but the problem with Khomeini be that the guy who he overthrow be put in power by the United States .
I can not quite figure that out .
SANDERS we overthrow -lrb- unintelligible -rrb- and put the Shah of Iran in power .
everybody know that .
the CIA do that .
NOVAK but I mean you be attack the CIA for put he in , when it be -- the problem be Khomeini .
SANDERS No , the point I make , Khomeini come about because we put a brutal dictator , the Shah of Iran , in power .
the point that I be make be you can not ... HAYWORTH the point you be make be blame America first .
SANDERS No I be not .
HAYWORTH that be what you be do .
SANDERS you be talk about blowback .
you do not know what happen when the most powerful nation on Earth invade and occupy a muslim nation and kill ten of thousand of people .
HAYWORTH we know what happen .
BEGALA Congressman Sanders -lrb- UNINTELLIGIBLE -rrb- .
Bernie Sanders , a Independent from Vermont , thank you very much .
Congressman J.D. Hayworth , a Republican from Arizona , thank you both very much .
we will come back to this debate , believe I .
one of we viewer , though , think there be a sure fire way to get that al Qaeda ring leader to talk .
we will let he fire back in a little bit .
but next , out of all of the picture from this weekend 's nail biter between J.D. Hayworth 's alma mater of -lrb- unintelligible -rrb- state , and Bob Novak 's beloved University of Maryland , only one photo be dramatic enough or politically charge enough to be the crossfire `` Picture of the day . ''
you do not want to miss this .
-lrb- applause -rrb-
NOVAK Question ?
CHRISTA DEMORE Hi .
I be Christa Demore -lrb- ph -rrb- from Monrovia , Maryland .
and I be curious , how can Democrats claim that President Bush be ignore the war on terror if al Qaeda 's second key operative be just catch ?
NOVAK and it also prove you can even chew gum and walk at the same time .
do not it show that ?
BEGALA he can not eat a pretzel and watch a football become at the same time .
so I be still doubtful of -- no , here 's why .
this be a serious point and you deserve a serious answer .
the way we catch that guy be by coordinate with we ally .
we now have a foreign policy in Iraq that be put enormous strain on those ally .
the same weekend they arrest the guy , we have ... -lrb- crosstalk -rrb- novak we have no part in it .
BEGALA No , it be a joint effort by Pakistan .
why do we want to sever that relationship with this idiotic war in Iraq ?
NOVAK we be not sever it -- question .
BEN CHARLTON Hi .
I be Ben Charlton -lrb- ph -rrb- from East Lansing , Michigan .
I be -- if we wait for U.N. approval for action in Iraq , do not we sacrifice some of we national sovereignty ?
NOVAK Well , where be all of the conservative question ?
we never have conservative in the audience .
there be no question .
I think even Paul would agree with I .
the question of whether we go to war or not be strictly a national question .
it be not a United Nations question .
BEGALA that be correct .
the president have get all of the legal authority he need .
I just pray to god he do not use it .
we need to go to the U.N. because we want to build coalition so we have support around the world and so that we do not have to carry the burden ourselves .
but legally he have no obligation to go back to the U.N. from the left I be Paul Begala .
goodnight for crossfire .
NOVAK from the right , I be Robert Novak .
join we next time for another edition of crossfire .
PAUL BEGALA , CNN CO-HOST hello , everybody .
welcome to crossfire .
on this Ash Wednesday , the pope ask Catholics to fast for peace and he ask President Bush to work for peace , while the White House send out Colin Powell to make yet another case for war .
we will debate all of that as well as `` Vanity Fair '' 's latest , stunning revelation about Michael Jackson .
believe it or not , we get new news on Michael Jackson .
do you think he really look like a mummy ?
certainly not a daddy .
but first , we own little moonwalk across the political landscape , the `` CROSSFIRE Political Alert . ''
the foreign minister of France , Germany and Russia today issue a joint declaration that they will not allow a second american-backed resolution to pass the United Nations Security Council .
President Bush want the Security Council to explicitly authorize force against Iraq , and he press secretary today remain optimistic that in the end , that be just what he will get .
President Bush be say to be focus on one fence-sitting Security Council member , the african nation of Guinea , because he say -- quote -- `` I use to have one of they pig . ''
so -- ok , I make that up .
he do not say that .
TUCKER CARLSON , CNN CO-HOST Well , I suspect that .
you know ... BEGALA but they be a swing vote .
Guinea be a important swing vote .
CARLSON as be Cameroon .
France and Germany be point to inspection and say , look , they be work .
we do not need war .
they be not point out that inspection be work only because there be the credible threat of war .
Saddam would not be destroy missile unless he think he be go to be destroy if he do not .
BEGALA I think that be a good point .
it do not mean we have to go to war .
but I think President Bush should get credit for push to instruction and back they up with the threat of force .
CARLSON it mean when you take the threat of force of the table , you be likely to stop disarm Saddam Hussein .
BEGALA Yes , I be not say take the threat of force .
I be say we do not need to use force right now .
CARLSON Well , France and Germany would like to .
Secretary of State Colin Powell today respond to Saddam Hussein 's latest attempt to fool the world .
Powell call iraqi step toward disarmament -- quote -- `` too little , too late '' gesture , mean to split international resolve to force Baghdad to give up its weapon of mass destruction .
U.S. intelligence say Powell indicate Iraq have hide equipment to produce al-samoud 2 missile , even as it destroy exist one , missile that until recently , it claim not to have .
Powell also reveal that Iraq be hide chemical and biological weapon in poor neighborhood around Baghdad .
in order to secure peace , Powell conclude , the international community must confront Saddam Hussein 's refusal to disarm -- quote -- `` here and now . ''
so , there you have it .
the essence of the american case for war against Saddam Hussein .
the only question leave : who do you believe ?
Secretary of State Colin Powell or France ?
BEGALA No , the question be ... CARLSON that be the question .
BEGALA who do you believe : the Bush administration or you lie eye ?
we be watch they destroy weapon , as the president say , oh , that be just a hoax .
CARLSON but Paul ... BEGALA they be disarm .
CARLSON No , no , no that be not what the president 's say .
he be say , the -- it be a hoax to the extent that those be only a small number of the weapon there .
keep in mind , these be weapon that Saddam Hussein , until recently , say he do not even have .
he be a liar .
BEGALA of course .
CARLSON and to trust Saddam Hussein in effort to disarm he -- foolish task , do not you think ?
BEGALA absolutely .
nobody trust Saddam Hussein .
the question be , be he a sufficient threat to America today to risk the life of we young man and woman .
CARLSON that be a separate question .
that be a very separate question .
BEGALA I think he be not .
I think the inspection can work .
CARLSON that be a different argument .
we can take it up later .
BEGALA Well , those of you who still believe the myth of the liberal media should consider this : MSNBC , a obscure cable channel , have fire Phil Donahue , the host of its highest-rated show .
a memo from inside NBC , report on the web site allyourtv.com , and today in `` the Washington Post , '' show NBC big wig fear that the liberal Mr. Donahue represent in the word of the NBC memo -- quote -- `` a difficult public face for NBC at a time of war , while we competitor be wave the flag at every opportunity because he seem to delight in present guest who be anti-war , anti-bush and skeptical of the administration 's motive . ''
so there it be , accord to NBC .
Phil Donahue be fire because he be a liberal .
in fact , the only liberal with the solo cable talk show .
NBC , of course , be a division of the conglomerate GE , where they apparently only bring right wing thing to life .
CARLSON I actually like Phil Donahue .
I have interview he a number of time .
he argument be really dumb .
I do not know if you have listen to Phil Donahue .
delightful guy , but he argument do not make a lot of sense and I think that be the problem with liberal talk show host -- you exclude , of course , and James .
but the argument , actually , do not hold up very well .
have you notice that ?
BEGALA you know , you can argue back and forth , but you should not fire someone because of they political view and that be what NBC have do and shame on the General Electric corporation .
he have the highest-rated show on the network .
CARLSON which be say what ?
BEGALA I use to work there .
they be good to I .
they be very nice people and they be very good to I ... CARLSON ok , ok , I be not beat up on MSNBC .
BEGALA ... but they should not fire a guy for he political view .
CARLSON Former Illinois Senator Carol Moseley-Braun recently decide to run for president .
early review have not be good , so yesterday she announce she will be make some change .
not to she idea , which be few .
not to she record , which be pretty embarrassing .
not even to she staff , which be , of course , tiny .
but to she name .
from here on out , Carol Moseley-Braun as Carol Moseley Braun .
do you catch the difference ?
in the second version , there be no hyphen between she last name .
Moseley Braun expect that primary voter in Iowa and New Hampshire will react enthusiastically to this radical , grammatical transformation .
they will have to , because the latest CNN poll show Moseley Braun far behind the candidate she set out to discredit .
that would be , of course , the honorable Al Sharpton .
Sharpton be not only by far the first choice of black voter nationally , he be tie with Senator John Edwards among all voter and beat governor Howard Dean , Representative Dennis Kucinich and Senator Bob Graham .
beat they .
and Al Sharpton do not even have to change he name .
BEGALA how do he become honorable ?
CARLSON yes !
-lrb- crosstalk -rrb- BEGALA you become honorable by win a election of some sort or have a high post , be a ambassador or a governor or some thing .
CARLSON by embody the value of you party .
BEGALA you value , not mine .
CARLSON he be the no. 1 pick , the most popular , among all candidate , among black primary voter .
I mean , you can not dismiss he .
he be a serious candidate .
BEGALA we have not even begin the primary .
he be not a serious candidate .
he be right wing fantasy and it be never go to happen .
CARLSON not right wing .
take Al Sharpton seriously , that be we message tonight .
in a moment , we will ask two member of Congress if they be convince that war be the only way to make Saddam Hussein disarm .
later , the pope practice religion and a little anti-war politics on the side .
then , can you spell prosthetic nose ?
Maureen Orth can , and she do in a new `` Vanity Fair '' profile of Michael Jackson .
we will talk to she .
you will not want to miss that .
we will be right back .
CARLSON welcome back to crossfire .
France , Russia and Germany today restate they opposition to any new U.N. Security Council that could threaten Saddam Hussein 's grip on power .
Secretary of State Colin Powell go to the U.N. tomorrow to do what he can .
we be talk with potential war in Iraq with Congressman Charlie Rangel , a New York Democrat and he fellow New Yorker Republican Congressman Peter King .
BEGALA Mr. King , thanks for sty with we through the break .
one of the reason that we like have you on , and as well as Mr. Rangel , be that , you know , this be war , as we be say in the last segment .
you treat it with the gravity and the seriousness that it deserve .
and you be a congressman who have put he constituent and he country ahead of he partisan interest .
so I wonder if you will join Charlie Rangel , who put out a press release today , decry the republican attempt to hijack a bill to help we serviceman to use it to give special interest tax break to corporation .
be not that wrong in a time of war ?
king the important thing be that the bill pass for the military .
if the other stuff 's in there , it be there .
I mean to I , the main purpose should be the military .
I be not go to disagree with Charlie 's point .
on the other hand , often when bill be pass , there be thing attach to they .
so to I , the key thing be that we ought to be take care of the military and that be what we should do .
CARLSON Congressman Rangel , a couple of month ago Senator Daschle on CBS say -- make the charge that we be , quote , `` we have not make any real progress in the war against al Qaeda . ''
a lot of Democrats say similar thing .
this weekend Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , the no. 2 member of al Qaeda and another significant al Qaeda member be capture in Rawalpindi , Pakistan .
do not it turn out that Mr. Daschle and other do not know what they be talk about and maybe they should not make charge like that in public when they do not know what they be talk about ?
you would agree with that , would not you ?
RANGEL if they do not have the pencil that be keep score , they ought to keep they mouth shut because as a former federal prosecutor , every drug dealer I bust be the most important drug dealer in the world .
you just pass out number on whoever you arrest .
why be he no. 3 ?
why be not he no. 4 ?
CARLSON Well , I do not know .
because he help plan the attack on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon ?
I think that put you pretty high up in the organization .
-lrb- crosstalk -rrb- rangel let I tell you , when you arrest somebody , you describe who you be arrest .
I have not the slightest clue who this guy be .
CARLSON I have not hear anybody suggest that he be not one of the central figure in al Qaeda .
have you ?
RANGEL listen , we should be arrest a lot of people .
but I think the main thing that we have now be we should concentrate on Osama bin Laden , we should concentrate on dismantle Saddam Hussein .
we should do all of those thing , but the most important thing be we should not have the arrogance to have a preemptive strike against a defenseless nation without the ... CARLSON A defenseless nation ?
they have biological weapon .
how be they defenseless ?
BEGALA and how would they get they ?
RANGEL listen , if this be ... CARLSON it be we fault that they have biological and chemical weapon ?
come on .
RANGEL let I tell you .
they have it and we support they have it when they be fight Iran so it be no big deal there .
and the thing be that if we can disarm they without actually go there , kill they , I really think that we maintain we moral authority around the world .
we have a lot of people ... -lrb- applause -rrb- rangel ... that have dangerous weapon .
I mean , what happen if India decide that they could have a preemptive strike against Pakistan ?
what happen if the North Koreans take another look ?
we country be great enough and strong enough to maintain the moral authority to convince the international community that we be right .
I do not think we have to kill to prove that .
BEGALA I be sorry to have to do this , but we be out of time .
I want have congressman Peter King from New York back on , and Congressman Charlie Rangel .
thank you both for a very interesting debate .
one of the most admire man in the world be do everything he can to avert the horror of war .
in a minute we will look at he holiness , John Paul II 's effort to be a peacemaker .
later , the author of `` Vanity Fair 's '' scary new look at the King of Pop , Michael Jackson .
you will not want to miss this .
Stay with we .
BEGALA welcome back to crossfire .
maybe it be just I , but I think Michael Jackson , he be kooky , wacky .
Time now for `` Fireback , '' where we wacky and kooky fan and friend and critic right in .
Don from Denver , Colorado write , `` Paul , you keep reference Halliburton sell equipment to Iraq '' -- which I do .
`` I recall , as report in ` the Wall Street Journal , ' that the transaction be legal .
be it possible that the equipment allow Iraq to produce oil for the oil for Food program authorize by the U.N. ? ''
they be legal because Mr. Cheney 's company use a loophole .
they go through a foreign subsidiary .
but they do enrich Saddam Hussein and he evil , ruthless regime , and they be immoral .
they be wrong .
Dick Cheney should have never profit off of do business with Saddam Hussein .
CARLSON I would agree with that .
what do that have to do with the war in Iraq ?
BEGALA it mean Cheney be a hypocrite .
he be try to lead we into a war against one of he value customer .
CARLSON Well it be a complete ... -lrb- crosstalk -rrb- CARLSON you be attack the man .
that be irrelevant to the argument .
BEGALA I be attack he business practice .
CARLSON No , no , you be attack -- ok great .
that be great .
but it have nothing to do whether we should go to war with Iraq or not .
BEGALA Well yesterday he be a value customer , today he be a even villain .
-lrb- crosstalk -rrb- CARLSON Right .
so we be against Dick Cheney , but that do not have anything to do with Saddam Hussein .
Chad Hensley , from Fairfax , Virginia , write , `` France , Russia and German have all multi-billion dollar oil deal with Saddam in Iraq .
I wonder why they protest the war with Iraq .
it must be the humanitarian reason . ''
well , Chad , that be what liberal assume .
that Europe be against the war on humanitarian and moral grounds , but the U.S. be for the war because it want to profit for the oil company .
it be a weird assumption , do not you think ?
BEGALA as you know , I have never say that .
CARLSON you have not .
BEGALA I do not believe for a minute that this be a war for oil .
I think it be unwise , it be unjust , it be unwarranted , but I do not think it be about oil .
now , the reason that France , Russia and Germany be against war be because they have democracy .
the people be against it .
it be call democracy .
those leader be reflect the view of they people .
CARLSON they hate America , Paul .
CHRISTINA WRIGHT my name be Christina Wright -lrb- ph -rrb- .
I be from Minneapolis , Minnesota .
and I be just curious if you feel that the attack on Iraq would actually open a Pandora 's box in other Middle Eastern country that we be know to aid and harbor terrorist , such as Syria and Iran .
CARLSON it might .
I mean that be absolutely one of the fear .
that it would destabilize the entire region .
on the other hand , the region be pretty unstable , fill with people who already hate Americans and seek to do America harm .
so the question be , could it be worse ?
BEGALA we president believe it will set off a positive domino effect of democracy through the region .
maybe he be right .
I do not think he be think it through .
I think it be more likely that this very unstable region could cause even more problem .
-lrb- crosstalk -rrb- CARLSON oh , come on .
that be silly .
FABIAN Hi .
I be Fabian from Bonn , Germany .
and my question be , after today 's meeting in Paris , where France , Russia and Germany decide to not back a second resolution , who be not -lrb- unintelligible -rrb- ?
be it the U.S. or be it old Europe ?
CARLSON it be actually western Europe , because 18 european country be on the side of the United States .
so France and Germany -- that be actually true -- find themselves in the minority on they own continent .
and good .
BEGALA only great Britain be with we .
the only country ... CARLSON what do you mean only great Britain ?
BEGALA my question be not who vote at the U.N. .
who send troops to die on we side ?
nobody except great Britain .
we be isolate .
from the left , I be Paul Begala .
goodnight for crossfire .
CARLSON from the right , I be Tucker Carlson .
join we again tomorrow night for yet more crossfire .
WOODRUFF we know that some of the american troops now fight in Iraq be longtime veteran of warfare , probably not most , but some .
they military service go back to the Vietnam era .
other , though , be novice .
so what be it like for they to face combat far from home ?
for a idea , here be CNN 's candy Crowley with some war story .
-lrb- begin videotape -rrb- CANDY CROWLEY , CNN SR. .
political correspondent -lrb- voice-over -rrb- they be , we be tell , well train .
SEN. CHUCK HAGEL -lrb- R -rrb- , NEBRASKA this be a messy business .
there be nothing very pretty about the training that you take to prepare you for combat , because it be to kill people .
CROWLEY in the spring of 1970 , a squad of U.S. soldier spot a small unit of Viet Cong that have be circle for day .
Staff Sergeant Tom Ridge open fire .
a Viet Cong soldier drop dead .
-lrb- on camera -rrb- : do you at the time or have you since look back and ponder on kill someone ?
TOM RIDGE , HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY Mm-hmm .
CROWLEY and what be that like ?
RIDGE that be one of those introspective time where it be just -- it be just a introspective time , not a public time .
crowley -lrb- voice-over -rrb- Duke Cunningham be a Vietnam fighter ace shoot down five enemy plane .
after he first , he return to a ship deck full of sailor and crew cheer , shake he hand , push in to slap he back .
REP. RANDY CUNNINGHAM -lrb- R -rrb- , CALIFORNIA and one of the guy look at I and say : Duke , what be it like to kill somebody ?
and , all of a sudden , bang , it just hit I .
you do not think about those thing .
and it be remove .
it be far off .
it be not in close .
and I go to the priest , because it bother I .
I know I could do it again .
but I do not know it be go to bother I as much as it do .
and it still do .
CROWLEY of all the wound time do not heal , the one that fester deep in the soul be the wound you inflict .
ridge it be not something that civilized people do .
you do not -- it be just not -- it be not a matter of be torment , but trouble in the sense that that be not what we do , unless we be call upon to do it , under the most extreme set of circumstance .
CROWLEY War may sometimes be a necessary thing , but it can never be a natural thing .
train bridge that gap .
sergeant Chuck Hagel be seriously wound twice in Vietnam .
HAGEL you be try to kill people , because the alternative be , if you be in combat , you will be kill .
so you choice be not vary .
it be very simple .
and so you do what you be train to do .
you do what you be there to do .
and , in Vietnam , it be body count .
CROWLEY training be what keep you run toward the front while truck load with dead body pass you , go the other way .
REP. CHARLES RANGEL -lrb- D -rrb- , NEW YORK it be hard to explain what training can do .
train set you mind to respond not to common sense and judgment , but to training .
you really do not have time to think : I be go the wrong way .
I should be go the other way .
CROWLEY later , when he be wound and trap behind enemy line in Korea , Staff Sergeant Charlie Rangel lead 40 man , fight they way to safety .
he win a bronze star .
RANGEL if you be kill people , it be out of fear , not really , in my opinion , out of bravery .
nobody be look for medal .
everyone want to live another day .
CROWLEY do not misunderstand .
Rangel , Cunningham , Ridge and Hagel be all proud , decorate combat veteran .
it be just , a decade later , kill still trouble the soul .
maybe that be a good thing .
-lrb- on camera -rrb- : do you do it again ?
CUNNINGHAM I do .
I shoot down four more mig .
and I often tell myself -- I say that , if I ever get use to this , I should not be here .
crowley -lrb- voice-over -rrb- candy Crowley , CNN , Washington .
-lrb- end videotape -rrb- WOODRUFF remarkable interview and a reminder that what these man and woman be go through right now in Iraq , they will remember for the rest of they life .
that be we coverage this hour .
-lrb- begin videotape -rrb- tuchman -lrb- voice-over -rrb- as they get ready to head over hostile territory , 10 man aboard this Air Force hc-130 search and rescue and refuel plane start to feel they adrenaline rush .
who look out for the unlikely prospect of iraqi aircraft , and the more likely prospect of iraqi missile or artillery .
-lrb- on camera -rrb- : do you mindset change across the border into Iraq ?
unidentified male no , because I be in a area which I do not know where the enemy could be and I might get to the airplane , by the time I get out of the airplane I be think the same way .
TUCHMAN which be ?
unidentified male the hair on the back of my neck start stand up , then something 's go wrong .
TUCHMAN -lrb- voice-over -rrb- as a precaution , the crew start turn the huge plane in circle to see what the target do .
ultimately it be discover the target be U.S. combat helicopter .
Minutes later the search and rescue helicopter arrive for its refuel .
watch the flash from we night vision camera as the plane 's fuel line connect with the chopper .
both aircraft fly at 125 mile per hour gingerly over enemy land .
at time they be only 50 foot apart with the chopper 's rotor blade get closer .
look with the naked eye out of the plane , the helicopter be impossible to see .
the pitch-black maneuver end after 10 minute .
-lrb- on camera -rrb- : what stop though - we know the Iraqis have fire sand missile and fire AAA at aircraft all throughout this war .
they have not hit anybody , but be not it risky fly so low know they have that ammunition to fire at you .
unidentified MALE Again , we know where we be go .
we know where they be at so we simply avoid they and if for some reason they do get off a lucky shot or they do see we , we have defensive system on board the airplane to defeat they ammunition .
TUCHMAN we all fly with bulletproof vest in case the plane go down .
we also fly with parachute in case we need to get out before the plane go down .

WOODRUFF that be something to look at .
today the Pentagon be compare suicide bombing attack on coalition force in Iraq to terrorism .
four U.S. Army soldier be kill when a suicide bomber attack a military checkpoint today in Najaf .
CNN 's Chris Plante be chase all that down for we at the Pentagon right now .
hello Chris .
CHRIS PLANTE , CNN PENTAGON CORRESPONDENT Hi , Judy .
that be right .
four U.S. soldier from the 3rd Infantry Division man a checkpoint near the town of Najaf kill today in a apparent suicide bombing .
a man drive what appear to be a taxicab come to the checkpoint , wave soldier over , appear to be have mechanical problem of some kind .
as the soldier approach , the man detonate explosive in the car kill all four of the soldier .
this be something that iraqi Vice President Ramadan have say would take place .
he say this long before the conflict ever begin .
he reiterate today in a press conference in Baghdad that this would just be the beginning of this that they would plan on kill thousand of U.S. troops with suicide bombing similar to this .
also , in southern Iraq today near Basra , two member - claim to be member of Saddam 's Thataeen -lrb- ph -rrb- group surrender to U.S. troops say that they have be order to carry out suicide bombing down there but that they do not want to die for the regime so they be surrender .
at the Pentagon briefing today , General Stanley McChrystal say that it look a lot like terrorism .
MCCHRYSTAL it look and feel like terrorism and what it require be unit to conduct forced production activity which they be prepared and do all the time but clearly when you see a tactic like this , it require strict adherence or adjustment to you tactic , technique and procedure to ensure that place like checkpoint be not vulnerable .
so it will not change we overall rule of engagement .
it do not effect the operation at large but to protect we soldier it clearly require great care .
PLANTE so certainly a unpleasant development today Judy and another item on the docket over here today be the failure of a number of cruise missile .
Tomahawk land detect missile be from launch from ship in the eastern mediterranean and in the Red Sea have suffer a number of failure .
the Pentagon say a total of seven of the cruise missile have fail crash in Turkey and in Saudi Arabia .
no injury report .
the missile be program so that they do not detonate until they reach they target .
if they go astray , then the warhead never arm but claim that it be about one percent of the warhead .
they have fire 675 or so tomahawk land detect missile from ship and seven of those have fail .
Judy ... WOODRUFF Chris , very quickly , new information from the Pentagon today about any concern they have about Saddam Hussein 's ongoing air defense capability ?
PLANTE Well , no major concern .
the Pentagon say that they do have air dominance as they now call it over the vast majority of the country that there be certain area and only certain area of downtown Iraq where battle management radar link to surface to air missile be still in tact .
the reason that they be still in tact accord to today 's briefing be that they have not turn they on and as long as they do not turn they on , the U.S. have trouble locate they .
they assure we that as soon as they do start turn on these radar that they will take those out too and finish the job in term of airspace over Baghdad.Judy ... WOODRUFF All right .
we be pay attention to all those detail for we , Chris Plante at the Pentagon .
you be look at live picture of Baghdad where there have be more strike , more bomb drop , more missile this evening and of course as always , CNN keep a close eye , a close watch , a close listen on what be go on in Baghdad .
come up , coalition force control several part of southern Iraq but they still face some serious problem include pocket of resistance .
that story when we come back .
since march into Iraq , coalition troops have engage in some fierce battle with Saddam Hussein 's force .
a serious problem they still face though , pocket of resistance .
reporter David Bowden be with the british force in Umm Qasr in southern Iraq .
-lrb- begin videotape -rrb- DAVID BOWDEN , CNN CORRESPONDENT House clearance Royal Marine style , troops from -lrb- unintelligible -rrb- commando task to seek out the last pocket of iraqi resistance in Umm Qasr go in hard to arrest suspect regime sympathizer and search for weapon .
it be not pretty and there be no please and thank you but for the Marines , every door potentially hide a gunman and when you life be on the line , manners go out the window .
the Iraqis arrest look bemused -lrb- ph -rrb- and plead innocence but with many militia here , pretend to surrender only to open fire on they captor later , first impression can be deceptive and lethal .
this patrol do find hidden weapon .
they be not the first and they be unlikely to be the last .
the Marines believe they have a firm hold on Umm Qasr right now but they can not afford to slack in they grip and allow those who be hostile to the coalition force to regroup and begin again they cycle of violence .
the Marines with they sniper have now sniper have now spread they area of operation north to include the town of Umm Kiou -lrb- ph -rrb- .
as in Umm Qasr before it , they be here to clear out the opponent to regime change .
a man in this vehicle take a pot shot at the commando .
it be a painful and bloody mistake .
MAJOR ROB MACGOWAN , ROYAL MARINES we send in one of we company of about 100 man in here this morning and we take about 12 or 13 prisoner , three or four enemy be injure and they have now be fly out and we be treat they include a man who be almost dead with a gunshot wound to the chest .
we have now evacuate they out and the enemy now have either flee or they have be capture .
BOWDEN The Royal Marines be satisfied they be in control of this small corner of Iraq .
they task now be to keep it that way .
David Bowden in southern Iraq .

WOODRUFF that report file just a short time ago .
well , CNN analyst Ken Pollack who be with the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution be with I now .
he be a expert on the iraqi military and its tactic and weapon .
Ken Pollack , that resistance that we just see the british troops deal with , you and I be talk earlier today .
the story the last few day have be the surprising level of resistance but you be tell I you sense be that the coalition force be begin to adjust to that .
KEN POLLACK , CENTER for MIDDLE EAST POLICY , BROOKINGS INSTITUTION Right .
I mean we be see one of the great advantage of U.S. and british force now , Judy , which be that they be superbly train troops .
they have training in a whole variety of different mission and they be adapt .
they recognize now they go in with some false assumption about the kind of reception that they be go to face .
the plan that be implement have some inherent risk in it , risk to the supply line , risk in term of not clear city and they be shift .
they be change and the troops be train well enough to be able to deal with that .
you have see U.S. Central command bring up additional force like the 82nd Airborne Division to better deal with these long supply line , get control over the city and so I think that U.S. and british force be begin to stabilize the battlefield .
WOODRUFF so as a onlooker , as somebody who be study the iraqi capability , be it you sense that the coalition can continue to adjust to whatever they deal with ?
POLLACK absolutely .
one of the thing I think we be likely to see be that the Iraqis be go to have a tougher time adapt than U.S. force be .
typically what you have see in the iraqi armed force be the change have to come from the top .
it do not come from the ground up .
you do not have ground commander call back and say hey , we would like to try this tactic or this seem to work .
tell everybody else to do the same thing .
instead the high command have to identify a problem , come up with a solution and transmit it down .
chance be the Iraqis be go to continue to stick with what we have see before , irregular force blend in with civilian try to attack U.S. force , some more of these suicide attack which be go to be problematic for we troops .
there be no way around that but U.S. force , british force be begin to adapt to it .
WOODRUFF I want to ask you about you mention coalition force go in expect more support from ordinary iraqi people .
I just interview a gentleman , native of Iraq , who talk to he family there all the time and he say they live in Baghdad 20 , 30 , 50 of they and he say they do the view the Americans as invader .
they hate Saddam Hussein .
they do not like what he be do but they do not think the Americans be the answer .
POLLACK All right .
well , this be something that we have be try to get a grip on for year , exactly what the iraqi people feel and also that I think the best evidence that we have before the attack begin be that Iraqis do , they despise .
they be desperate to be rid of he but by the same token , they do not like another country come into they country to overturn the government and beyond that , I think it be probably most important for most Iraqis be they be deeply suspicious of the United States .
they remember that the United States betray they in 1991 .
the U.S. do not finish Saddam then .
President Bush - then President Bush call on they to rise up and then the U.S. do nothing and so they be deeply suspicious of what we have in mind .
WOODRUFF which raise question go forward .
one last thing , Ken Pollack I want to ask about this british official say that they have information that Saddam Hussein have fire he air defense chief .
what be the significance of that ?
POLLACK Well , if it be true and obviously we do not know just yet but if it be true , it be very significant because it be effectively the Iraqis admit that many of the civilian casualty that we have see over the last few day may in fact have be cause by iraqi surface to air missile fall back to ground in residential area .
WOODRUFF -lrb- INAUDIBLE -rrb- POLLACK exactly , in that market and I think it be pretty apparent when you look at the video of that market , if that have be a U.S. bomb or a U.S. cruise missile , that market would have be obliterate .
chance be it be a iraqi surface to air missile .
WOODRUFF we be go to go quickly to northern Iraq now where we find CNN correspondent Ben Wedeman .
there be be some action in that area .
Nick -lrb- ph -rrb- - I mean - I be sorry .
Ben , we can make you out just barely but tell we what you have be see .
BEN WEDEMAN , CNN CORRESPONDENT Yes .
Judy , you be see we through the night scope because basically for the last hour we have be watch as this ridge behind I in Kalak which of course be the front line between Iraq and Kurdish -lrb- ph -rrb- force , we have be watch as plane , plane we can hear but can not see , have be bombing the ridge line behind we .
five huge explosion within the space of less than a hour as these plane drop these massive bomb on the iraqi position behind we .
not just iraqi position behind we , in addition to that in the direction of Mosul as well which be a major northern iraqi city about 28 mile to the west of I .
we have also see some massive blast to the south as well so it appear that this bombing in this area continue and we have really see the most intense bombing of the war in this area in the last 24 hour .
Judy ... WOODRUFF Ben , what be you best understanding of what it be on the ground that the coalition force be go after there ?
WEDEMAN Well , basically on the ridge itself it be the most forward iraqi army position and we have be watch they very closely for the last month prior to the war to the outbreak of the war and basically these be the position that control this entire valley .
up there they have heavy machine gun .
they have mortar .
they have anti-tank gun , hundred of man along this very long ridge that basically run from the north to the south .
in addition to that , we know that further back behind those line in the direction of Mosul there be heavy artillery and tank as well , this accord to the people here in this area , the local Kurds who have be go across the line for many year basically engage in smuggling .
now precisely what they be hit to the south of we be unclear but my understanding be that there be further iraqi position in that direction as well .
Judy ... WEDEMAN Ben Wedeman describe coalition hit in the area where he be , the town of Kalak in northern Iraq .
he just call in and we want to get this report to you right away .
Ben , very - we thank you very much for that and we will be come back to you as the night - as the night wear on .
we be get close to the bottom of the hour .
we be go to get some headline at the hour right now with Heidi Collins .
WOODRUFF I hope they get a little rest .
when we come back , one of the many sad aspect of this war , humanitarian aid rush to people who need it but not everybody get what they come for .
slowly humanitarian aid be roll into southern Iraq but dramatic scene like this one of a crowd tear into the supplies on a convoy truck only underscore how desperate the need be .
correspondent Martin Geissler file this report from the iraqi town of Safwan .
-lrb- begin videotape -rrb- MARTIN GEISSLER , CNN CORRESPONDENT as we convoy roll through southern Iraq the desperation of the people here soon become evident .
in truck and on foot they come to the town of Safwan .
these people have be without food or water supplies since the war begin .
now they be desperate .
within seconds the Kuwaiti aid worker who have organize this trip be overpower by the mob .
these desperate scene be exactly what the aide agency want to avoid .
this be survival of the fittest .
only the healthy and strong can get to the food .
the weak and the ill be leave with nothing .
despite this effort to help the iraqi people , resentment be never far away .
unidentified male we hate U.S. .
we hate british , England .
we hate any state in war here .
GEISSLER what do you think about Saddam 's regime ?
unidentified MALE Saddam 's very good man .
GEISSLER as the supplies run out the mood swing from frantic to ugly .
delivery driver be threaten .
one of the bus in we convoy be hold up at knifepoint .
the troops have move into Safwan .
we , as a consequence , have have to move out .
it be simply too dangerous .
this be a clear indication that despite the coalition reassurance that this part of Iraq be safe and despite the aid be bring into the people here , it be still a very , very volatile area .
Tonight here the strong be eat .
the weak still go hungry .
Martin Geissler , ITV News , Safwan southern Iraq .
-lrb- end videotape -rrb- WOODRUFF so many different picture we be get from across that country .
well , they be make they voice hear at home and abroad .
when we return , Americans this weekend be march against the war and in support of the troops .
we will check out some of the demonstration .
here in the United States this weekend just as they do last weekend , anti-war protester take to the street .
in Los Angeles , the International Black Coalition for Peace and Justice be sponsor a rally for peace today .
Congresswoman Maxine Waters be among those schedule to attend .
in the meantime further north in California , San Francisco be the setting today for a rally aim at boost the moral of the american troops in the Persian Gulf region .
CNN 's Rusty Dornin be with we from San Francisco .
Rusty , what sort of crowd be show up there ?
RUSTY DORNIN , CNN CORRESPONDENT Well Judy , this be the largest group really we have see of the support the troops rally that have be over the last few week .
of course this be the home of the anti- war demonstration stem back to the Vietnam war but there be close to between 500 and 1,000 people .
I be get various estimate on the crowd .
we do want to show you a interesting thing here .
some folk be show some solidarity with the speaker here .
you be look at some of San Francisco 's police department 's officer .
I do ask they why they do that .
they say they be wear skullcap so they decide to adopt this to show solidarity .
they say the department have not make any statement about whether they think that be all right or not .
this have be a very peaceful demonstration .
as I say , the officer do tell I that this be the largest pro-troops demonstration that have ever be in San Francisco since the Vietnam War .
so far , very peaceful .
as I say , there have be a few verbal exchange but one of the most enthusiastically receive speaker here be Bessam Al-Husaini , a iraqi American .
he be with the iraqi American Council .
how do you feel about support the troops ?
how do the iraqi American Council feel ?
BESSAM AL-HUSAINI , IRAQI AMERICAN COUNCIL Well the iraqi American have be wait for this liberation and they want to get rid of Saddam so bad and they will have to take it the way it be be offer to we .
DORNIN how do you feel though see picture of civilian injure in the bombing ?
AL-HUSAINI we get report that these civilian especially in the -lrb- inaudible -rrb- population have be attack by the iraqi regime themselves so they can not blame the american and say look what the american do to we .
he would love to see this and would draw on this emotion from the Arab world and the european country .
DORNIN now you say you do talk to you family in Baghdad as well and they also be somewhat suspicious of the Americans .
AL-HUSAINI Well , I mean the iraqi people have be the primary victim from the whole thing .
yeah my family , you know , still in fear .
you know they stay in one room .
they board all the - all the window and they build with a brick one of the window face the street .
I mean yes , you know , my prayer to they but we can only do so much .
hopefully it will be a short war .
it will be attack the iraqi regime .
we can live in liberty and freedom soon .
DORNIN now I understand some of the people here have be threaten by anti-war protester .
have you have anyone either threaten you or ... AL-HUSAINI No , no problem .
this have be a very peaceful demonstration .
DORNIN ok .
thank you very much .
AL-HUSAINI thank you .
DORNIN Bessam Al-Husaini here and it have be a very peaceful demonstration .
it be wrap up this afternoon and it look like the civil disobedience act by the anti-protester be schedule to get underway once again next week .

WOODRUFF it be in northern Iraq today that a eight artillery round hit the site occupy by kurdish fighter near Chamchamal .
it happen near a area abandon earlier by iraqi force .
CNN 's Kevin Sites be in northern Iraq .
-lrb- begin videotape -rrb- KEVIN site , CNN CORRESPONDENT this be the road to Kirkuk .
a day ago it be control by iraqi troops and pack with these land mine but now we can drive far enough to see the outskirts of Kirkuk .
that be because coalition fighter jet pummel this iraqi position on the hill above Chamchamal and iraqi troops make a hasty retreat .
this be what the hilltop look like now , crater 15 foot deep , busted bunker and twisted metal , scatter ammunition and tattered clothing , a helmet , a tube of toothpaste .
kurdish peshmerga fighter take they place .
I be glad to see they go this one say .
they kill a lot of we people in Chamchamal but I feel bad for they too .
some of they be only conscript .
some Kurds take advantage of the iraqi retreat right away .
this one take a bulldozer to a concrete portrait of Saddam Hussein .
it take about 20 minute but finally it come topple down .
he say after finish the job he hope Saddam Hussein himself will fall too but despite the exuberance of Kurds in the area , it be clear it be much too early to celebrate .
although the Iraqis retreat from this area , at dusk they fire what observer say be seven artillery round back at they former stronghold create new fear and potentially new casualty .

Wolf Blitzer 's report start right now .
-lrb- begin videotape -rrb- WALTER RODGERS , CNN SR. .
INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -lrb- voice-over -rrb- the situation here appear to be increasingly tense .
a few moment ago , out on the horizon , not very far ahead of the U.S. Army 's 3rd squadron , 7th Cavalry , we hear more than a few explosion .
the U.S. Army 's 3rd squadron , 7th Cavalry have compile a rather extraordinary record in the past several day .
it be the first unit to cross the Euphrates River and then punch northward to within 60 mile of Baghdad .
it be the Army which assign I to the 3rd squadron , 7th Cavalry , and that be extremely fortuitous .
it be like sit in a poker game and draw four ace , because this be a crack unit .
it be the tip of the tip of the spear .
we have have a absolutely terrific story , push forward north toward Baghdad .
seventy-two hour of that be under constant fire come at we from both side of the road .
unidentified male we just hear a incoming -- what the hell !
unidentified male no , no , I do not know what it be .
RODGERS recall Winston Churchill 's old quote , `` there be nothing so exhilarating as be shoot at and miss . ''
what you try to do be stay calm and continue you broadcasting .
the worst thing you can do , either as a soldier or as a war correspondent be panic .
we be hear incoming .
we be not sure what it be .
we see some stuff in the sky .
we may have to break this off .
I think we be go to break off this live shot for the time be .
we be not sure what we see up there .
Goodbye .
we have get to dive for vehicle , we think .

bye .
we have under heavy fire for the past couple of mile .
mostly small arm fire , but the sand storm have enable the Iraqis to come very close to the road , and if I sound a little nervous , it be because we be in the soft skin vehicle and everybody else be in armor .
we would like to now show you what we call old Betsy -lrb- ph -rrb- , a re-used , secondhand U.S. Army Humvee that we have be travel with .
any bullet will pass through it , even a .22 caliber bullet .

this be what we have literally be live in .
this be the kitchen , when we be down , and we be very fortunate , because we have get a teapot .
that be my cubby hole .
it be extraordinary cramped , because -lrb- unintelligible -rrb- sandbag the floor , in case we hit a mine .
that be all the space I have to eat and sleep in .
you do not sleep .
you really do not sleep out here .
of course , you be on a adrenaline high , but race across the desert , you know that you be travel toward the jaw of what could be a major military battle .
you have to realize , they have be ride along , bounce along in these tank for probably six or more hour now .
and if you ride inside that tank , it be like ride in the bowels of a dragon .
they roar , they screech .
the hardest part of the trip be personal discomfort .
we can not tell you the level of personal discomfort we have experience .
the extraordinary sandstorm , the bitter cold night .
the most uncomfortable thing be have to sleep sit up in a humvee with sandbag under you foot , you knee at you chin .
that be excruciatingly uncomfortable , not something that you would wish on anybody but a contortionist .
let I give you a example of what the dust like .
look at this .
we have be through day of dust like that .
the U.S. Army 's 7th Cavalry have just take three iraqi prisoner of war .
actually , they be very close , that be to say , no more than 40 yard away , but the dust and sand be blow so badly you be get these vague image .
it be like be in a blizzard , except unfortunately , the sand do not melt as the snow do .
what we eat be what the Army call mre , meal ready to eat .
and I must say , they be pretty darn good .
and of course , everybody fight for the best one .
the treat be thing like the m&m s and the breakfast toasty .
the Army be eat much , much better than the grandfather of these soldier do and the great grandfather of these soldier in the second World War .
let I hold the camera and show you my crew .

WOODRUFF All right , Wolf , and we will be watch .
thanks very much .
well , at the Pentagon briefing this afternoon , official describe several unit of the Republican Guard as effectively no longer be a credible fight force .
let 's get the very latest from the Pentagon for the overall war picture as they see it .
we Jamie McIntyre we senior military affair correspondent be with we now .
hello , again , Jamie .
JAMIE MCINTYRE , CNN SNR .
military affair CORRESPONDENT Well Judy , the Pentagon be begin to see positive sign that it have not see for awhile .
First of all , as we see just a few moment ago on CNN , the picture of some of the actual happy iraqi citizen welcome U.S. troops , that take place in Najaf .
also the Pentagon be see lighter than expect resistance indicate at least that they may have really seriously degrade those Republican Guard division before the U.S. troops arrive , both in Karbala and also in Al Kut .
they meet lighter than expect resistance .
but the Pentagon official stress that as they close in on Baghdad , this become the real dangerous part as they enter that so - call red zone where Saddam Hussein be believe to have give he commander authority to use chemical weapon , and that use of chemical weapon remain a real fear at the Pentagon .
-lrb- BEGIN video clip -rrb- MAJOR GENERAL STANLEY MCCHRYSTAL , joint chief , vice dir .
we be not expect to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it in a coup de main , or anything like that .
so , in regard to that , we be pay great attention to they ability to defend on the ground .
they may just suddenly be effective on the ground .
additionally , they ability to use chemical and biological weapon , they have prove it historically .
we believe they have the capability now .
clearly , as we threaten the core of the regime , which Baghdad and Tikrit represent , we believe that the likelihood of they use those weapon go up .
-lrb- end video clip -rrb- BLITZER in less than 24 hour , the U.S. 101st Airborne Division have drive iraqi Fedayeen fighter from the key city of Najaf , push north in a several-pronged attack .
the Army 's 3rd Infantry have punch through Karbala , meet only light resistance from the Medina Republican Guard , and move along highway nine within 25 mile of Baghdad .
at the same time , the Marines from the 1st division have secure a key Tigris River cross near Al Kut and report to have essentially destroy the combat fighting ability of that light infantry Baghdad division that be suppose to be provide defense down there .
at the U.S. Central command briefing this morning at the forward headquarters in Doha , Qatar , General Vincent Brooks say that the U.S. would be continue to approach Baghdad .
he say , quote , `` the dagger be clearly point at the heart of the regime now , and it will remain pointed at it , '' he say , `` until the regime be go . ''
Judy .
WOODRUFF Jamie , these description of the weakening of the Republican Guard begin to bring back memory of the first Gulf War 12 year ago .
be there a chance that coalition force could , at this point , be overestimate the strength of what be left of the opposition ?
MCINTYRE Well , they might be .
and that might be a good thing .
they be take it very cautiously .
no one , again , they stress the most dangerous part of this could be ahead .
could be urban combat .
could involve chemical weapon .
could be the most loyal fighter leave as they draw into Baghdad .
could be a very dangerous time .
they also be careful to point out that even while they say that the division have be destroy , they do not mean every single person have be kill .
simply that its combat effectiveness have be eliminate - Judy .
WOODRUFF we notice they say they do not want to use the word destroy , in fact , they say let other do that .
Jamie McIntyre at the Pentagon .
WOODRUFF Well , rescue american prisoner of war Jessica Lynch be expect to arrive at Ramstein air base in Germany just about a hour from now .
CNN will have live coverage of she arrival .
Lynch be rescue in a daring raid by U.S. force on the Saddam hospital in Nasiriya .
this nightscope video show troops carry the 19-year-old Army private to a Blackhawk helicopter .

when she be in Germany , Lynch will be treat for bullet wound and broken bone .
she be report to be in stable condition .
she and more than a dozen other member of she Army maintenance unit be ambush near Nasiriya more than a week ago .
WOODRUFF meantime in Palestine , West Virginia , there be a lot of joy over the news of Jessica Lynch 's rescue .

we will have more on the march toward Baghdad after a quick break .
we preview the potential battle ahead and the strategy in play when we check in with we military analyst .
-lrb- commercial break -rrb-
WOODRUFF U.S. force move ever closer to Baghdad , but military official say they be not count on capitulation .
for a look at what might lie ahead for U.S. force , let 's turn to we Miles O'Brien in Atlanta .
mile o'brien , CNN ANCHOR thank you very much , Judy .
to help guide we through all this discussion about red zone , and dagger and exactly what be the strength of the Republican Guard , we turn to Colonel Patrick Lang .
he be retire with the United States Army .
he spend some time in the Defence Intelligence Agency , among other thing .
Colonel , good to have you with we .
COL. PAT LANG -lrb- RET , -rrb- , U.S. ARMY you be welcome .
O'BRIEN what do you suppose right now would be the governor on the forward advance ?
be it the Republican Guard or be it the U.S. and coalition supply line ?
or both ?
LANG Well , they be close enough up to Baghdad now so that the supply line issue be probably not a big one since they have time to restock , food , fuel and ammunition .
so , probably the main thing be comb through the rubble that the air force have leave of these Republican Guard division to make sure there be no strong point that you leave behind , that could threaten you line of supply once they get past .
once they be satisfied they be through all that , I would imaging there will be a pause while they start to reconnoiter into Baghdad , probe hard to see how much resistance there really be .
O'BRIEN Well , let I ask you that .
First of all , I just want to tell viewer where we just take we satellite imagery .
this be that Karbala area which be about 50 mile from Baghdad .
Baghdad be roughly in that direction from there .
we know the vanguard be supposedly as close as 15 mile .
one of the next key point along the way here be Saddam international airport .
do you suppose that be a key target right now ?
LANG oh , I be sure it be .
I mean a feature of that importance would always be something you would want to hold .
and besides , as soon as you get control of it you would be able to start use it for air operation , and put a survey team in there as soon as it be secure , and then start use it for helicopter operation , haul forward some big bladder of fuel to refuel helicopter and rearm they and thing like that .
and if the front stabilize between there and the downtown Baghdad , they will start use it for a fixed wing aircraft as well .
O'BRIEN now , as you go from Saddam International Airport into town you see there be some big , wide divided highway there .
control of these highway will be crucial will not it ?
LANG yeah , these be the high-speed approach into the heart of the city and armored force like the 3rd mechanized Infantry Division just love high-speed approach .
they will try to go down those thing , cut the city up into sector as best they can , and then work on the specific sector of the city they think be a key terrain .
I would think , probably , various facility as well as major government building that they need to control to set up a new government .
O'BRIEN it be a big city , about the size of Philadelphia or thereabout .
some have say Chicago be a good analogy .
tremendous amount of force need to control a city of that source , or be a wrong ?
LANG Well , it depend on the attitude of the populous , which be not clear yet .
if the population , in fact , or at least a big part of they like the shia half of the population , if they want to be liberate , then you can control they with a fairly small force .
if , in fact , a lot of people in the city do not want to be liberate and you be never go to know that until you try , then you be go to need a much larger force , and we might end up wait a couple of week for reinforcement .
O'BRIEN base on what you have see so far , what be you sense of that ?
the Shias be a bit gun shy , if you will , in the south because of what happen in 1991 .
they rise up , do not get american support .
do you suppose it will be a different story in Baghdad ?
be there a lot of latent hatred for Saddam Hussein that will come out ?
LANG Yes , there be , but these folk be go to be mighty cautious .
they have a long history of be kick around by the Sunni Arab population of central Iraq .
and they do not have any particular reason to trust we , so far .
so they will wait and see what happen .
it be the other people in the city you have to worry about , who be ethnically much the same as the Saddam Hussein regime .
and they behavior right now be unpredictable .
O'BRIEN Colonel Patrick Lang , retire , United state Army , thanks for you insight .
a man who have be to Baghdad many time and can tell we with great knowledge exactly what it be go to be like to fight on those avenue in that sprawling city of Baghdad - Judy .
WOODRUFF Always help Miles to hear a voice of experience .
thank you and thanks to Colonel Lang .
when we come back , hope rise among investor .
that mean stock be up today on Wall Street as they look at the progress of the war in Iraq .
we be go to check in with Rhonda Schaffler at the stock exchange in just a moment .
WOODRUFF as coalition force push ahead in they march toward Baghdad , they have encounter some resistance in the Shiite holy city of Karbala .
but american troops and they superior technology have turn out to be a key factor in the fight there .
and to the south , british force continue they attack on target around Basra .

-lrb- end videotape -rrb-
-lrb- newsbreak -rrb- woodruff with U.S. force roll closer and closer to Baghdad , the military seem to be zero in on the ground war .
but , as it have from the beginning , air power remain a important part of the battle .
let 's check in with CNN 's Gary Tuchman at a air base near Iraq .
Gary you have see it firsthand from the first moment .
GARY TUCHMAN , CNN CORRESPONDENT Well , that be right , Judy .
in two week after the air war begin , there be no let-up and no effective response from the Iraqis .
accord to the Air Force , at any give time , there be more 200 coalition aircraft either over Iraq , fly to Iraq or fly from Iraq .
we come to you from a base near the iraqi border .
many pilot be fly these a-10 attack plane behind I .
they also fly f-16 .
there be also Marine fa-18 and Marine Heriers at this base .
we can tell you that a lot of pilot of this base be not fly to another base in Iraq .
it be a base that be take over by the coalition last week .
and we spend part of the day at that base .
and when you arrive there , you be greet in a sense by Saddam Hussein .
-lrb- begin videotape -rrb- TUCHMAN this be Talil , Iraq .
the Talil Air Base .
but the be no more Iraqis here , the coalition take over this base last week .
it be now a major staging point .
you know you be in Iraq when you drive down the road come into the base and see the portrait of Saddam Hussein .
what be happen be the military personnel who have arrive here have take out they marker and be write message on Saddam Hussein 's portrait .
you can see the main one here on the bottom and also here message like , we win , April 1 , 2003 .
want to give you a look .
there be a lot of security personnel here .
you can look over there and you can see the military vehicle .
these be Air Force Security force with they rifle patrolling the entrance .
there be a lot of fight in this area .
we be near the town of Nasiriya .
but this base now be consider secure enough to make it a major staging point for the coalition .
-lrb- end videotape -rrb- tuchman a short time ago we talk to a pilot at this base who have be to that iraqi base and he too say he have sign that mural right on Saddam Hussein 's sash .
after he tell we that , we ask he during he mission , and he be fly about 30 in the last two week , we ask he do he still have any artillery be fire at he ?
-lrb- BEGIN video clip -rrb- UNIDENTIFIED MALE yesterday I be up just south of Baghdad by 30 mile and we be fight sa-2 and sa-6 and aaa on the ground .
so they be still out there .
but the air power and the air package that we take to the fight , we continue to be effective .
and we attrit the Medina force down to less than 50 percent .
and when we put we power punch to they and then the Army and the Marines move forward it be a very effective , coordinate effort .
-lrb- end video clip -rrb- TUCHMAN Lieutenant Colonel Webb -lrb- ph -rrb- be tell we he have a mission this very evening .
we want to tell you the Air Force have just inform we that between this morning and tomorrow morning , it will fly 1,900 sortie into Iraq .
a total over the last two week now of close to 24,000 sortie .
before we go , one more thing we want to tell you about , superstition .
military people be very superstitious , like many of we be .
here at this particular base they get they mre , they mre be they meal ready to eat .
they come in a bag .
and when you get a mre you get you meal and you get a little treat with it .
what a lot of people here at this base do , when they treat happen to be this one , this be the candy call charm , many of the people refuse to eat they charm .
they consider it a good luck charm to keep they charm in they clothes and not to eat they .
so one little superstitious tale for you , Judy .
back to you .
WOODRUFF Well , I be one of those who think that we need to pay attention to we superstition .
Gary , one another quick question for you .
that air base that coalition force have now take control of near Nasiriya .
be you able to say , be they actually use it or get much use out of it ?
TUCHMAN what they be do , Judy , some of these a-10 behind I go there to refuel , to stage operation further north .
they also fly these hh-60 helicopter , they be the search and rescue helicopter use in case they have to search and find somebody on the ground .
they stage there and refuel .
but right now , none of they be permanently base there , although the plan be for that to eventually happen .
WOODRUFF All right , Gary Tuchman with some charm .
you see he hold it .
I will be talk with a ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , Senator Joe Biden , just ahead , for he take on how the war be go .
could Tony Blair be in line for a gold medal ?
tale of how some in Congress want to honor the british prime minister .
WOLF BLITZER , CNN ANCHOR thanks very much , Judy .
with the power out now in Baghdad , we be get word that loudspeaker have be blare in the iraqi capital , urge citizen to go to the international airport there , presumably to defend it against coalition force .
now that armored column of u.s.-led troops have reach the outskirts of Baghdad , eyewitness report fight and shell around Saddam Hussein International Airport .
in the final push to Baghdad , U.S. force face limited resistance from iraqi troops .
but the Pentagon believe some iraqi Republican Guard unit have withdraw to the capital for what could be they last stand .
farther south in Basra , smoke rise over the city as coalition vehicle move in today .

Coalition force launch they latest advance toward Baghdad in the pre-dawn hour today , head toward the iraqi capital from the southeast and the southwest .

meanwhile , coalition commander post american special force be now operate at will .
these dramatic picture show a raid on a presidential palace less than 60 mile from Baghdad .
it seem to have be abandon , but the United States say it be still on the trail of Saddam and he closest circle .
BRIG. GEN. VINCENT BROOKS , U.S. CENTRAL COMMAND we remain cautiously optimistic .
we do not think that the fighting be over yet , and so there be still option available to the regime , include the use of weapon of mass destruction .
we take that very seriously .

WOODRUFF Gregory Lynch , the father of Jessica Lynch , and Jessica 's mother talk to reporter , say they have talk to she today , both before and after surgery , that she say she be feel good .
they say she will be good .
but they say the doctor do go in and apparently do some work on she spinal cord or spinal column .

WOODRUFF back now to the battlefront and to the southern city of Najaf , home to one of Islam 's holiest site , moment of tension that could have go either way today .
arm coalition soldier move toward a venerated mosque at the request of a muslim cleric , but angry local who do not understand what they be try to do .
CNN 's Ryan Chilcote be in Najaf with the 101st Airborne .
-lrb- begin videotape -rrb- RYAN CHILCOTE , CNN CORRESPONDENT -lrb- voice-over -rrb- a tip lead the Bastogne brigade 's no slack batallion to this parking lot in Najaf where the Fedayeen be say to have stash weapon .
the search turn up nothing .
the only resistance come from a Volvo .
the shia population seem curious and friendly but they do not get too close .
this man agree to be interview as long as he face be not show .
the iraqi government , he say , have satellite tv .
anybody could be a informer and punish we for talk to you , even my family , he tell I in Arabic .
the troops also keep they distance .
unidentified male yes , it be very uneasy out here .
do not know who be who .
CHILCOTE Sergeant Rod Sutton from Indiana on the corner of a street lead to the highly sensitive Imam Ali Shrine , one of the holiest site in the world for shia Muslims .
do it make you nervous that you be so close to the Ali mosque ?
do you feel like you be tramp on .
SGT. ROD SUTTON , BASTOGNE BRIGADE Holy ground ?
CHILCOTE Yes .
SUTTON to some extent , I feel fortunate that I be here , because this be something I never would have see before .
and now that I see it I kind of understand some of the history behind it .
so , it make I more appreciative of it .
to the same extent , I do not want to be invasive with these people here .
I do not want to trample on they holy ground , and I want to respect that as much as I can .
CHILCOTE word come from the grand Ayatollah Sistani that he be willing to meet the american commander , but he ask first for soldier to secure he compound , located halfway down the road to the mosque .
no one explain that to the crowd .
-lrb- on camera -rrb- : there be no more striking example of the sensitivity that the U.S. soldier face here than what be take place on the street right up from the ah Ali mosque right now .
-lrb- voice-over -rrb- : chaos as the crowd apparently believe the soldier want to approach the shrine .
unidentified MALE they want to get inside the holy shrine of Imam Ali .
CHILCOTE Clerics appear with a message from the grand Ayatollah , but the message be do drown out .
the colonel instruct he man to stay calm .
unidentified MALE they get to understand , he want we here .
smile , relax .
CHILCOTE he soldier take a knee , they weapon bring down from the ready position .
they do everything soldier can to appear less hostile .
but the potential for confrontation remain .
the commander make the decision .
unidentified male turn around , just turn around and go .
CHILCOTE he order he man back to they compound to await cooler head .
Ryan Chilcote , CNN with the 101st Airborne in Najaf , Iraq .
-lrb- end videotape -rrb- WOODRUFF and CNN 's Nic Robertson tell we earlier , significant that the shia muslim ayatollah , what they do , that they be cooperate with coalition and U.S. troops , say that that will send a important signal to shia Muslims throughout the country .
well , U.S. official be investigate two possible friendly fire incident in which coalition force may have mistakenly shoot at ally aircraft .
in one of the incident , a soldier be kill and several other wound .
before word of that death , 40 Americans have be kill by hostile fire in Operation iraqi freedom .
eleven of they by friendly fire or in other accident .
most of the 27 british troops kill have be victim of friendly fire or accident .
meantime , Iraq say that 420 civilian , they say , have be kill during the war .
and they say 4,000 injure .
U.S. official say more than 4,000 Iraqis have be capture .
seven Americans we know remain prisoner of war in Iraq .
fifteen other be say to be still miss in action .
well , when they do finally enter Baghdad , U.S. and coalition troops could face urban combat with the Republican Guard , some of whom may have withdraw into the city .
but the U.S. military be expect to remain focused on specific target in the iraqi capital .
nevertheless , CNN 's Miles O'Brien be with we military analyst , Lieutenant Colonel Robert Leonard , he be a Persian Gulf War veteran and a military science professor at West Virginia University -- Miles .
mile o'brien , CNN CORRESPONDENT thanks very much , Judy .
and Colonel Leonhard , we be go to talk a little bit about urban combat .
and I want to just start this off by say a lot of people when they hear about urban combat , they think of that Blackhawk down scenario , Mogadishu and the problem that can go wrong here .
this be not probably a comparable situation , be it ?
LT. COL. ROBERT LEONHARD , U.S. army -lrb- ret . -rrb-
not in any way .
and one of the reason be because we have armored fight vehicle there in Baghdad , and we will use they .
those tank have 120-millimeter smoothbore gun on they .
the Bradleys have 25-millimetre chain gun and coaxial machine gun .
that be a lot of mobile protective gunfire .
completely different from the Mogadishu situation in which we do not have such vehicle .
and we also be not go to use similar tactic there .
we be much more likely to use patience and finesse rather than assault tactic .
O'BRIEN All right .
we want to show you a animation , and share with we viewer , maybe you can point out a few thing about this .
if we move in on Baghdad , and give you a sense of the kind of target that might be encounter in urban combat .
what we have depict here be something here which show some armor sort of off the wing here , right over here be a mosque .
we depict that to show that be something you obviously want to stay clear as we just see with the Ryan Chilcote piece from Najaf .
as we get a little bit closer here , in a typical scenario like this , you might very well have Republican Guard sniper up on balcony like this , and possibly up on the roof of building and anti-aircraft artillery or artillery encampment like that .
what we have present she be a armored column with air support come in .
how much jeopardy be a column like this in as it go through these concrete canyon in a city ?
LEONHARD it be a great question .
I think the animation be good because it do show that you can hide literally anywhere in a city environment , and that be why movement through a urban area be very , very dangerous .
it be the side that be move that be go to take the casualty .
that say , the armored fighting vehicle that you see there they look to I as if they be move a little bit faster as than we probably will .
we will use patience and finesse .
we will take the time to locate the enemy , surround the block and the building that he be in .
and then we will probably surge fire into they both lethal and nonlethal to make he position untenable , to make he move rather than we move through the assault zone .
at which time we can engage they or arrest they .
O'BRIEN we would like to resume with that animation if we could .
that be Saddam International Airport .
that be another segment .
can we get back to the animation .
and I would like to just finish this out .
here we go .
ad we move it along , you will see eventually the troops will come march in .
in this case , slightly off target here because you see they all go in the front door .
typically , when they would assault a target like this , they would do what ?
LEONHARD Well , typically , if they do go in , which be generally the option of last resort , but if we do have to go in , often we will try to go in from the top of the build down .
one of the reason be because we use grenade a lot in clear building , and grenade ten to offend downhill rather than uphill .
so , you always want they go down staircase rather than have to try to throw they up the staircase .
O'BRIEN Interesting , all right .
gravity rule , even in urban combat .
lieutenant Colonel Robert Leonard , we appreciate you insight in urban combat , something that be not something that the U.S. military would prefer to engage in , but it might become inevitable .
thank you very much for you time .
we appreciate it -- Judy .
WOODRUFF thank you , Miles and thank you Colonel Leonhard .
all of that certainly help we visualize what might happen .

wreckage burning in a hangar as U.S. troops rush in .
at dawn this morning , U.S. tank and infantry have roll in to claim they biggest prize of the war so far .
building by building , they sweep the terminal complex , then move on to secure the runway .
the fall of he airport be a humiliating blow for Saddam .
it lie just 12 mile from Baghdad and will be a key forward base for U.S. troops as they prepare for a push on the capital .
more than 300 iraqi soldier have be leave dead .
some Republican Guard troops fight fiercely on the northern side of the airport complex .
unidentified male hopefully , this be a sign that we be able to send to the resident of Baghdad that we be here and they can rise up and deal with the regime appropriately .
mate outside the airport , the fighting be fierce , but the battle unequal .
here , the remains of a iraqi armored car , and by its side the body of a iraqi soldier , all that remain of a column that push up the airport road last night in a final effort to defend the airport .
U.S. troops be now knock on the door of Baghdad .
but the final push into the city could yet prove to be the toughest fighting of all .
-lrb- on camera -rrb- : the patchy , somewhat disorganized defense of the airport last night have leave coalition commander with several question .
have they do so much damage now to iraqi command and control center that they can no longer put up a proper fight , or be the best troops simply withdraw into the city , to fight there street by street ?
the answer to that could well decide how quickly they make a final push into the city .

well , as coalition force push ahead in they bid to capture Baghdad , big question remain about Saddam Hussein and he whereabouts .
it be still not clear , look at the latest tape of the iraqi president , whether he be dead or alive .
CNN senior international correspondent Nic Robertson , who be expel from Baghdad , be with we now from the border of Iraq and Jordan , on the jordanian side , to talk about what be happen in the iraqi capital .
nic , we be get information in bit and piece about the incursion by coalition land force , about air flight over the city .
help we pull it all together .
NIC ROBERTSON , CNN senior INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT Well , from what we hear from source in Baghdad this evening , it have be mostly quiet in term of bombing throughout the day in Baghdad .
then there be a large explosion not far from the hotel journalist be stay in in the center of Baghdad .
along the riverfront there , there be a number of Ba'ath Party house and building that appear to be -- have some sort of military function .
it be not clear exactly what the target be .
what we be hear from iraqi people in the capital today be that they know and they have see coalition force in the southwest of the city , in the southeast of the city .
they say they have also see coalition force and believe coalition force have a checkpoint on the northern outskirts of Baghdad as well .
so as far as the iraqi people be concern , they be very aware that coalition force be right on the perimeter of the city .
we source be also tell we that iraqi force be mass artillery piece and tank at a number of location on the southwestern edge of the city .
these location , actually , very close to the center of Baghdad and appear to be form something sort of front line against the coalition force .
now , Iraq 's minister of information today say that the coalition do not have control of the airport , that this be some sort of contrived video from the first day , and that , in fact , hundred of coalition soldier have be kill , and they grave be now at the airport .
he do promise to take journalist to the airport , however , he never make -- he do not make good on that promise throughout the day .
the information minister also read a statement from President Saddam Hussein today , the iraqi leader call on people to be resolute , to be strong , and say that if they put up a good fight , then the coalition would eventually back down .
-lrb- BEGIN video clip -rrb- MOHAMMED SAEED AL-SAHAF , IRAQI INFORMATION MINISTER -lrb- through translator -rrb- but to harm the enemy more and more , go against the enemy and destroy the enemy and follow the plan that you get in write .
God be great .
May the criminal lose .
-lrb- end video clip -rrb- ROBERTSON now , representative of the committee -- the International Committee for the Red Cross , who have be to some of the hospital in Baghdad , report higher-than-usual number of casualty come into those hospital .
-lrb- BEGIN video clip -rrb- ROLAND NUGUENIN-BENJAMIN , INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE of the RED CROSS -lrb- on phone -rrb- we have a chance in the morning to go to the main hospital , which be call Yarmuk -lrb- ph -rrb- , and we find there have be a steady flow in of hundred of casualty , all over the night and through into the day , casualty -- I mean , war wound have to be send over , dispatch to other hospital , because this yarmuk be just totally overwhelm by the sheer number of people come in .
-lrb- end video clip -rrb- ROBERTSON now , these Red Cross representative say that most -- that two-third of the casualty they have see in this particular hospital be , in fact , military casualty .
and iraqi official promise to take journalist to this particular hospital , the Yarmuk Hospital , that be now located , it be on the southwest of Baghdad , and it appear to be pretty much between the position of where coalition force have be see and where Iraq now have a militarized front-line position .
now , when journalist be take to see that hospital , twice they be turn around and tell that they be not actually allow to go inside that hospital , Judy .
WOODRUFF Nic , when you say Iraqis be see now put artillery piece out and around the city , be you say out in the open , where they can -- where they be vulnerable , or be they make any attempt to hide they ?
give we clearer picture of that .
ROBERTSON one of the area where I understand they be locate tank and artillery piece be the Zawara -lrb- ph -rrb- park .
this be fairly central in Baghdad on the edge of a government area .
it be a garden -- it be a large garden-type area for people to take they child to go and play .
it be -- there be a small zoo there as well .
it be , if you will , on the -- face towards the southwestern area of the city .
it face off against the highway that lead out to the airport .
now , that be not in a residential area .
it be a clear , open area , apart from tree .
the other area that we understand where iraqi official be place tank and block off street be in more residential area , Judy .
WOODRUFF All right .
Nic Robertson , give we a better understanding of exactly what the Iraqis be do to prepare for any further move by coalition force .
nic , thank you very much .
well , as american force do push ahead toward the iraqi government 's key center of power , british force be keep up they work to the south of the iraqi capital .

JULIET BREMNER , ITV news -lrb- voice-over -rrb- dominate the city gate to Basra .
Saddam Hussein and he henchman still claim to control this southern port .
but the british want to send a powerful symbolic message .
soldier be here to tear down the regime and all it stand for .
by the time they leave Iraq , they be determine Saddam and he Ba'ath Party will have bite the dust .
the approach can seem frustratingly slow , but day by day , the Desert Rats be exert more control .
checkpoint mean to filter out iraqi hardliner .
-lrb- on camera -rrb- : they be well within striking distance of the mortar and rocket of the Fedayeen militia , but they be prepare to take that risk to try and persuade the people of Basra that they will not desert they , that they will stick with this however messy it get .
-lrb- voice-over -rrb- : drastic action be need to convince a dubious population .
unidentified MALE get down , get down !
BREMNER we watch a nighttime raid on the home of Ba'ath Party official and Fedayeen militia .
these be man single out by local and believe by army intelligence to be behind much of the brutality and corruption .
most be not accuse of specific crime but suspect of be part of the state-sponsored climate of fear .
unidentified male -lrb- unintelligible -rrb- , get up !
BREMNER the party 's influence extend to every corner of iraqi society .
in two small community , we witness more than 70 people be round up .
some be clearly terrify of what lie ahead , uncertain of they fate , overcome by nerve .
but as it end , there be no british apology for the scale of the operation .
unidentified male we come in firm , we come in fair .
there be no shot fire .
we give a good warning before we come in .
we have be play warning to people to stay in they house , and we have only lift those people we have get very good intelligence on .
BREMNER this be not a tactic that can be regularly repeat , or the british risk be accuse of install they own rule of terror .
despite the discomfort of a few , there be a conviction that this be a night 's work that will benefit the majority .

WOODRUFF Well , U.S. force enter Baghdad do face the prospect of urban combat , a type of battle they have train for , but , of course , they would prefer to avoid .
for more now on the unique challenge pose by urban combat , let 's go back to Atlanta and join the man whose voice we just hear , Miles O'Brien .
hello again , Miles .
O'BRIEN hello again , Judy .
I be join by J. Kelly McCann , we security analyst , a man who be spend a lot of time learn about urban combat .
you know , just those two word together , I think , scare a lot of people because of all the thing that can go wrong .
you know , I be impressed , look at this map , it almost look like a chess game , kind of sterile .
that be -- could not be further from the truth , could it ?
J. KELLY MCCANN , CNN SECURITY ANALYST absolutely not .
this be very clean and it be very orderly .
suddenly when we show the videotape and we start to go there , you will see just how conflict a environment that be .
O'BRIEN and all happen so quickly .
MCCANN -lrb- UNINTELLIGIBLE -rrb- .
O'BRIEN Let 's roll some tape .
we be go to kind of play it and stop it , and Kelly 's go to walk we through , I guess , Urban Combat 101 .
what be we see here ?
MCCANN just there , I mean , just get the door out of the way , you can see where the weapon have to go .
now , you just see this soldier right here , he be go to he sidearm to make a little bit more mobile .
and he be get to be careful of he muzzle point at he partner right here .
now , he be go to go that direction , because that room be clear .
go ahead and stop the tape.as you make every entry , Miles , there be two dead spot , one , of course , in this direction right here , which you can not see from the doorway , the other in this direction right here , and that be always the problem , because as you come in here , you have get to be able to get in there quickly and make sure that this person here do not get shoot in the back .
so ... O'BRIEN All right .
now , what about this , this armor ?
tell we how they be equip with armor there .
MCCANN Level 4 armor , this be not just for frag .
this will also stop bullet .
and there be a difference .
the normal flak jacket will stop fragment from grenade , et cetera .

you just hear John report about it .
they primarily talk about the war in Iraq , the aftermath of Iraq .
but they also discuss the Middle East and , as well , get the northern Ireland peace process start up again .
it have be say that Saddam Hussein rule Iraq with a iron fist .
I guess you can say in the past tense .
he regime have leave behind some disturbing evidence to support those claim .
the abandon secret police headquarters in Basra be just one example .
ITN 's Bill Neely be with the Royal Marines and he take we on a tour of Basra 's chamber of horror .
-lrb- begin videotape -rrb- bill neely , ITN reporter -lrb- voice-over -rrb- Saddam Hussein 's Iraq be a state of terror , and this be where it be plan and perpetrate , the headquarters of he secret police , this one in Basra .

what be to follow be a horrific education in terror and torture : in the smoking basement of the bomb building , a warren of cell .
here , prisoner be tortured .

NEELY these man have relative murder here .
so desperate be they to tell they story that they begin reenact what they and they brother and friend have suffer .
the hook in the ceiling be for one purpose only , another hook in a different cell and a different form of torture .
Saddam Hussein control Iraq through fear , torture and execution .

-lrb- on camera -rrb- : if there be a evil center to Saddam Hussein 's regime , then it be surely here and in other place of torture .
and there be plenty here that we simply can not show you .
in this block , it be man over here , hundred of they , and woman and child here .
-lrb- voice-over -rrb- : to call all this a chamber of horror be a cliche .
and this place be beyond cliche .
the hundred or thousand who die here who be give no trial , no voice , cry out .
on the ground , I find a book call `` the psychology of interrogation , '' as if the man who work here for Saddam need a handbook .
I be glad of the fresh air and glad to leave , glad I could .
no one know yet whether the new Iraq will be the kind of place where these child can grow up free of the fear , the horror of torture .
Bill Neely , ITV News , Basra .
-lrb- end videotape -rrb- WOODRUFF Unspeakable .
journalist kill in the line of duty in Baghdad -- how neutral be reporter in a war suppose to be ?
we Jeff Greenfield examine that question when we come back .
WOODRUFF Well , the journalist ' death raise question about the tactic of U.S. troops try to take control of Baghdad .
they also serve as a reminder that many of we colleague cover this war be put they life on the line every day .
some thought now on the danger from we senior analyst , Jeff Greenfield .
-lrb- begin videotape -rrb- JEFF GREENFIELD , CNN SR. .
analyst -lrb- voice-over -rrb- when a Al - Jazeera reporter be kill today , the network charge it have be target by U.S. force .
Central command say , no , its force be trade fire from a hotel where the network be house .
at a nearby hotel , two other journalist , a photographer from Reuters and another from Tele 5 Spain die , another case , CENTCOM say , of coalition force return fire .
a kurdish journalist die in a U.S. friendly-fire accident in the north .
and a american writer/editor , `` Washington Post '' editorial columnist Michael Kelly , be kill when he Humvee plunge into a canal while evade iraqi fire .
-lrb- on camera -rrb- : it be a elementary fact of life during wartime : a press pass provide no protection .
-lrb- voice-over -rrb- : Famed World War II reporter Ernie Pyle be kill by a sniper on a island in the Pacific .
famed combat photographer Robert Capa , who take a classic photo of a fighter 's death during the Spanish Civil War , himself die from a land mine in Indochina .
Sean Flynn , son of the famous actor Errol Flynn , disappear in Cambodia in 1970 .
more than 65 journalist of many nationality die in Southeast Asia .
ABC News producer David Kaplan be kill by sniper fire in the Balkans in 1992 .
sometimes reporter , like `` The Wall Street Journal '' 's Danny Pearl , die in cover a different kind of war .
Pearl be murder by terrorist in Pakistan .
the casualty count help put the ongoing debate about journalistic neutrality into a sharper light .
the 600 journalist embed with american troops in Iraq will be threaten by the same fire as the troops they be cover .
they safety , they life , may depend on those troops .
neutrality in a firefight ?
not likely .
and that raise a bigger question .
be they suppose to be neutral on the outcome of the war ?
in a interview with broadcasting and cable magazine , CBS News President Andrew Heyward say of the neutrality notion -- quote -- `` it be one of the stupidest thing I have ever hear .
this story be go to be tell from a U.S. point of view .
we be american reporter , the one with the troops . ''
-lrb- on camera -rrb- : now , none of this mean journalist will ignore unsettling news : military setback , lack of supplies , the infliction of civilian casualty .
reporter who ignore or distort fact be betray they craft no matter what and no matter how much that may anger the people run a war .
but whether in the old Soviet Union or Nazi Germany or South Africa or Iraq , respect for the fact do not require a reporter to throw he value over the side .
Jeff Greenfield , CNN , New York .
-lrb- end videotape -rrb- WOODRUFF and tonight on `` LARRY KING LIVE , '' Al-Jazeera correspondent Omar Al Issawi will talk to Larry about the death of he colleague and the continue plight of journalist in a war zone .

just now , we want to show you scene from Andrews Air Force Base just moment ago , President Bush return to the United States from he summit in northern Ireland in Belfast with British Prime Minister Tony Blair , the president back on american soil after a quick two-day trip , less than two-day trip to Belfast , he and the prime minister discuss , of course , the war in Iraq , what happen after , as well as the peace process in the Middle East , and restart the peace process in northern Ireland .
the president then climb aboard Marine one , the helicopter , head back to the White House , where he will arrive pretty soon .
still ahead : how be the world react to the war in Iraq ?
when we return , we Richard Quest take a look .
Stay with we .
WOODRUFF you be look at live picture of the White House where President Bush watch some of the television coverage of event in Baghdad today .
separately , Vice President Cheney share he thought in a speech in New Orleans .
with I now for more on all this , CNN 's senior White House correspondent John King .
John , they have to be happy there .
JOHN KING , CNN SNR .
white HOUSE CORRESPONDENT Judy , they be .
behind the scene privately here you get a palpable sense of vindication , although publicly caution be the watchword here , administration official from the vice president on down say the war be not over yet .
some of the toughest fighting could still be ahead .
mostly they believe in those northern Iraq area Brent Sadler be just talk about before the break .
but they do believe the picture out of Baghdad today , on the one hand , send as powerful a message as you can send to the people in the Arab world who have criticize this war .
people in Baghdad celebrate .
U.S. troops assist in pull down that statue of Saddam Hussein .
across the Arab world , the administration hope to send a signal that the United States be there to help the iraqi people regain control of they own country , as a liberty , not as any imperial or occupy force .
of course , at the same time , though , the White House worry that the american people might see these picture and think the war be over .
Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney among those say the toughest fighting might still lie ahead , still unanswered question about the whereabouts of Saddam Hussein and other key member of the iraqi leadership .
the vice president make that argument today .
but even as he sound that note of caution , you do sense a little tiny bit of we tell you so .
-lrb- BEGIN video clip -rrb- DICK CHENEY , VICE PRESIDENT of the UNITED state Bottom line , with less than half of the ground force and two-third of the air asset use 12 year ago in Desert storm , Secretary Rumsfeld and General Franks have achieve a far more difficult objective .
yet until this war be fully win , we can not be overconfident in we position .
and we must not underestimate the desperation of whatever force remain loyal to the dictator .
-lrb- end video clip -rrb- KING we will not hear from the president today , we be tell , but before the week be out and perhaps as early as tomorrow official say the president be likely to offer he thought on the challenge just ahead .
so , again , behind the scene , a sense of vindication , but also a cautious attitude because of the fighting still to come .
I have to tell you , though , Judy , the CIA Director George Tenet walk out of the White House a short time ago with a giant smile on he face .
I can not recall a moment since September 11 , 2001 and those tragic event when we have see the CIA director look so happy .
WOODRUFF Well , John , give all that you have say , we know that there be a american retired general waiting in Kuwait .
but in addition to that , what step be they already take at the White House to plan for a post-saddam Hussein government in Iraq ?
king they be plan to accelerate that planning process .
Jay Garner the retired general will go into Iraq soon with he troops soon .
I say troops .
they be civilian from the U.S. government .
that will take place soon .
they be await for word from the Pentagon that it believe the security environment be secure enough for that to happen .
and begin as early as next week , there will be a series of town meeting , if you will .
the invitation will be issue by General Tommy Franks .
they be try to identify Iraqis from within the country , as well as iraqi dissident and exile , the diaspora they call it here at the White House , who will be part of a planning process to begin the process -- they say it could take week or more -- of select who should be part of that interim iraqi authority .
now , we know , one person who will be invite be plan process , those plan meeting , be Ahmed Chalabi .
he be the leader of the iraqi National Congress .
he be know to be a favorite of Vice President Dick Cheney , of Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Rumsfeld 's top deputy , Paul Wolfowitz .
he will be involve in the planning and in those meeting .
but I also should report that there be a sense of annoyance here at the White House , even among some of Mr. Chalabi 's top supporter , that , since return to Iraq in recent day , he have complain frequently , include on we air earlier today , that the United States be move too slowly to get in the reconstruction effort , to restore electricity and restore water .
over at the Pentagon today , Defense Secretary Rumsfeld , again , a supporter of Mr. Chalabi , say that , in he view , service be already at they prewar level .
and Mr. Rumsfeld go on to say , Secretary Rumsfeld go on to say , there be still a war go on , still quite a dangerous situation -- Judy .
WOODRUFF Yes , we catch some of that irritation in he choice .

WOODRUFF some picture .
well , Laith Kubba be a iraqi exile who have family member in Iraq .
Mr. Kubba be a senior fellow at a think tank call the National Endowment for Democracy .
he be also the president of a group of iraqi exile , a group call the Iraq National Group .
he join we now from London to talk about rebuild he country .
Mr. Kubba , first of all , you thought as you have watch these scene of Baghdad , the Saddam Hussein regime fall in the last day ?
LAITH KUBBA , PRESIDENT , IRAQI NATIONAL GROUP it be a huge sigh of relief , because it could have be much worse and Baghdad could have be a war theater with more destruction to property .
and , obviously , there be four million people who could have suffer more .
so , there be a sigh of relief that it be not worse .
but , obviously , there be a great , great concern about the scene that you have be show on television .
WOODRUFF be you talk to family member now in Baghdad and around Iraq ?
and , if you be , how concerned be they about the lawlessness ?
KUBBA Well , not in the recent three or four day .
there be no phone line to Baghdad .
in other part of Iraq , I receive with great sadness the killing of one close colleague , Saeed Abu Naji Abhuey -lrb- ph -rrb- in Najaf .
he be not kill by former member of the Baath Party or the security of the army , but by just a local organized group .
so those sign to I be worry .
people be sense and feel the lack of authority or the power vacuum and be test it .
and the more they test , the more I think they be claim .
WOODRUFF how difficult will it be to sort out who will next hold power in Iraq after this transition period , however long it be , where the U.S. be in charge ?
KUBBA Well , one need to break down this process into various element .
today , there should be a authority .
and it be very likely that the U.S. and the british force be the authority on land .
and there ought to be administration .
and this ought to be primarily by Iraqis .
but when it come to government , I think we really need to map out step by step how to move from this power vacuum to the day we have election .
we need to involve the U.N. .
we need to involve all iraqi force in the country , outside the country .
but we need to do it quickly , because every day pass by with this vacuum , it be go to spell trouble .
WOODRUFF Well , we know , Mr. Kubba , there be several iraqi exile group compete for influence .
be one of they go to have a advantage ?
and , particularly , I have in mind the iraqi National Congress that Mr. Chalabi , who be assist by U.S. force in get back into Iraq ?
KUBBA I think it be one thing to gain fame and access to Washington .
it be totally another to gain legitimacy and function grounds inside Iraq .
and I think plan must not be draw in thin air out in Washington .
it must really be draw on the ground inside Iraq .
and there be 22 million people there .
it be not a void .
it be not a vacuum .
and I think all plan must be anchor there in Iraq in its reality .
WOODRUFF so do one group have a advantage over another now ?
KUBBA there be different group who have advantage over other in different part of the country .
unfortunately , we do not have a national group that can appeal to Iraqis as Iraqis within a credible voice.this need to be construct , maybe through a conference to be hold in Baghdad , where representative from province all over Iraq need to participate , as well as political group .
but we do not have a single group , a single leadership or a single council yet .
WOODRUFF we be talk with Laith Kubba , who be the president of a group of iraqi exile .
the group be call the Iraq National Group .
Mr. Kubba , we thank you so much for talk to we from London .
KUBBA thank you .
WOODRUFF we appreciate it .
KUBBA thank you .

ROTH that be as close as resident of New York 's Upper East Side district get to know Aldouri , who keep a low profile , like many in the big city .
it be a neighborhood you would not expect the diplomatic post of a enemy government to turn up .
ALDOURI I be very thankful for the people of New York , for they generosity .

-lrb- end videotape -rrb- WOODRUFF Well , Baghdad be a city where drinking water and work telephone be hot commodity .

thanks for join we .
BLITZER welcome back to late edition .
we return now to my interview earlier today with the United States defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld .
-lrb- begin videotape -rrb- blitzer I know during the war , before the war , you be very concerned about the position of the syrian government , cooperate with Iraqis , have a open border , if you will .
have the situation improve , especially in the aftermath now of the secretary of state 's meeting with Bashar al-Asad ?
RUMSFELD Well , I guess time will tell .
I talk to Secretary Powell this morning on the phone a bit , and it be not , I think you need to let the dust settle on that .
he be , in my judgment , have a visit that be worth do , and the president ask he to do it , and it be the right thing to do .
we will see what progress come .
you know , word be one thing , action be another .
BLITZER but right now you be open-minded as far as Syria on whether they will crack down on terrorism , take some of the other step that you want they to take ?
RUMSFELD I know what they have be do , and it be be unhelpful .
I know that Secretary Powell be just there and advise they that it be unhelpful , and give they some pointer and some suggestion for the future .
in my view , they be make some unwise decision previously .
what they will do after this visit remain to be see .
BLITZER The secretary of state have write you a letter express , apparently , some concern about the length that the prisoner be go to be spending , those detain at the U.S. Naval base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba , about 600 or so of they .
be there any movement in try to determine the fate of these individual ?
RUMSFELD I do not think that be quite accurate as to what he write I about .
BLITZER All right , tell I what ... RUMSFELD I think what he write I about be the fact that the inter-agency process , where we have all these FBI and Department of Justice and CIA and DIA , and what have you , involve in interrogate these detainee , it take time to find out what intelligence they have .
it also take time to figure out what law enforcement process might be appropriate , and what Colin and I have be concern about , both of we , be that it be take so long .
there be a number of country , and the Department of State have the responsibility of deal with those country , that have foreign national in Gitmo , in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , be detain , and those country , understandably , would like to know when they could have those people.So the inter-agency process take a great deal of time .
Colin and I be try to speed up that process , and that be what that be all about .
BLITZER let I just , a couple of nugget to sort of wrap up before I let you go .
Victory parade for the troops .
I remember cover General Schwarzkopf , the parade in Washington and New York after the first Gulf War .
do you want the troops to be honor in that way when they come back , to have parade in New York , Washington , elsewhere ?
RUMSFELD there be no question but that the troops , the young man and woman , do such a superb job that there have to be a way to honor they , and there will be .
and General Franks and he team have do just a superb job for we country and for the world , and indeed for the iraqi people , who have be liberate .
what be the best way to do that ?
in the case of 1991 , the task be to go in and get they out of Kuwait , and they do it , and they be properly greet come back to the United States .
in this instance , it be a very different task .
it be to remove that regime , and it be part of a global war on terrorism that be not over .
we still have to face the problem of a number of global terrorist network and terrorist state that exist , that work with those global network .
and on the one hand we will , in fact , find a way to honor the courage and dedication and talent of these young man and woman , and we will do it well .
whether it will be model off the 1991 thing , I do not know .
I kind of doubt it , because it be such a different circumstance .
certainly , we war plan be not model off of 1991 .
BLITZER one final question on North Korea .
if the North Koreans pursue they nuclear weapon ambition ... RUMSFELD Yes .
BLITZER ... a preemptive strike , be that something that be out there ?
rumsfeld I be not one who speculate about thing like that .
I know that back in the 1990s , in the Clinton administration , Secretary Perry call in the former secretary of defense , and we have a discussion , and they clearly have tee up a military option that they be consider , and they then at a certain moment be able to do some thing that persuade they that that be not appropriate .
but those be very serious issue , and I leave they for the president .
BLITZER President Bush aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln on Thursday , formally declare the successful accomplishment of the military mission in Iraq .
welcome back to late edition .
join we now be two key member of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee .
in he home state of Indiana , the committee 's chairman , Republican Senator Richard Lugar .
and here in Washington , democratic Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut .
senator , welcome back to late edition .
Mr. Chairman , let I begin with you .
be you among those who be begin to conclude that , when all the dust settle , the U.S. may not find weapon of mass destruction in Iraq ?
SEN. RICHARD LUGAR -lrb- R -rrb- , INDIANA No , I concur with Secretary Powell , Secretary Rumsfeld , the president , that weapon of mass destruction be there , and likewise , that we will be lead to they by people knowledgeable in the country as to where they be .
what form we may find they and what trace of destruction and all the rest of it will be very interesting and , likewise , the intellectual capital that be there to produce more .
because not much else be -- you do not need much to get it go again .
and that , I think , we have to be work with these people who be in the business to make sure they do not re-enter the business , much as we do with russian scientist under the nunn-lugar program .
BLITZER what about you , Senator Dodd , do you believe , in the end , they will find weapon of mass destruction ?
SEN. CHRISTOPHER DODD -lrb- D -rrb- , CONNECTICUT I have no evidence to the contrary .
and certainly , they have use they in the past .
there be no doubt about that at all , both in Iran and against the kurdish population .
so , whether or not they find they in the exact form that many would assume they would be the case -- possibly some get out of the country .
it would not surprise I to hear that .
but I be go to work on the assumption , base on the intelligence that have be gather , that the weapon of mass destruction exist .
BLITZER what if they do not ?
DODD Well , you know , they have use it in the past , and I think the point that Senator Lugar just make -- certainly have the intellectual capacity to do this be prove already by the fact they have use they in the past .
so , I would not dwell on that point specifically , because Saddam Hussein clearly be a producer and a user of biological and chemical weapon .
he clearly be on the track to acquire a nuclear capacity , and the world be a safer place today because he be not rule Iraq .
BLITZER Will the U.S. lose creditability , Mr. Chairman , if , if the U.S. find no hard evidence , no so-called smoking gun ?
LUGAR No , we have full credibility in Iraq .
we have prosecute with the alliance a successful liberation of the iraqi people , and we have clearly cause Saddam to destroy weapon of mass destruction , or at least to suppress evidence of they .
that be a victory of sorts.this be a facet that be important .
it be important in the war against terrorism that we rout out whatever be there and , likewise , the people involve , because they might help supply al Qaeda or other terrorist along the trail .
BLITZER Senator Dodd , how important be it for the U.S. to conclusively learn what happen to Saddam Hussein ?
DODD Well , it be important .
but I do not think it be as important as find Osama bin Laden , for the simple reason that I do not think Saddam Hussein today pose any threat , wherever he be .
if he be alive , obviously , he do not pose the kind of threat that a Osama bin Laden do with he cellular network around the world to reactivate al Qaeda and international terrorism .
so , it would certainly be good to know where he be .
it would be , certainly , to know , to apprehend he , to bring he before a court of justice .
but I do not think it be absolutely critical for the ultimate success of this mission that we apprehend he or find out what happen to he .
BLITZER and you agree with that assessment , Mr. Chairman ?
LUGAR Yes , I think that Senator Dodd be right on .
BLITZER what about the length of the U.S. military presence in Iraq , Senator Lugar ?
how long do you anticipate large number of U.S. troops will remain there ?
LUGAR Well , I be hearten by what Secretary Rumsfeld tell you in the last interview , that we will have troops there as long as necessary , but no longer than necessary .
I think that be a pretty good way to state it .
my own view be that the security of the country clearly be we responsibility presently .
we be try to pass that on to other .
likewise , the other government 's procedure , the fledgling beginning on democracy , and all the rest .
but that be go to require a undergirding .
now , in due course , as everybody point out , we may get help from other country .
we may bring in NATO ally or the United Nations or other people in the Arab world .
that would be helpful .
but for the moment , this be we responsibility .
and we ought not to be have large debate about how rapidly we move out .
and I be upset , in a way , to hear report that by the fall , three division out of five would be go .
I think Secretary Rumsfeld disabuse we of that today .
BLITZER and what about you , Senator Dodd , not only the length of time , but the cost to U.S. taxpayer ?
have you be give any ballpark estimate what this be go to cost the United States ?
DODD No .
well , what we have hear the number of reconstruction run around $ 100 billion .
we put $ 2.5 billion in , in the last supplemental appropriation bill .
so it be go to be costly .
these rfp , these seek bid on various contract be rather costly , and so it be go to be expensive .
and clearly the responsibility be go to fall principally on the United States .
now , I would hope that sooner rather than later we could see a civilian government emerge in Iraq , a democratically elect one , that there would be more cooperation from the international community , on both the peacekeeping side as well as the political restructuring that be necessary in Iraq .
and to the extent we can move that along more quickly , I think we be all go to be better off .
be the sole , or almost the sole power there , both in term of reconstruction and politically , expose we to great vulnerability .
BLITZER Senator Lugar , we have to take a quick break , but before we do , I want to just ask you , the U.N. role -- you say there could be a U.N. role .
do you specifically want the United Nations to have some sort of peacekeep role there ?
and secondarily , what about country like France , Germany , and Russia , which oppose the Bush administration 's war plan , do you want they shut out ?
LUGAR No , I do not want anybody shut out .
and I do hope the United Nations will play a vital role in Iraq , whether it be in peacekeeping or various other way , and I hope that that will occur soon .

that be california 's .
they reject challenge to the law of sentence of 25 year to life without parole for a man convict of steal some golf club and 50 year for a man who steal some videotape .
the idea be if you have three felony conviction , you be out of here .
the voter overwhelmingly pass the law in 1994 to offset the liberal and lenient judge to let bad people off with nothing more than a slap of the wrist .
they appeal to the supreme court on behalf of these two people .
currently in california , 7000 people serve 25 to year life sentence under the three strike law .
one-third of they -- not that .
300 of they be in there for thing like petty theft .
25 other state that have the three strike law .
and that bring we to the question .
it be a close vote .
5-4 in the supreme court .
here be the question of the day .
you can e-mail we at am@cnn.com .
it be design to counter the kind of thing that i find in the new york newspaper this morning where a brooklyn woman who scald she 4-year-old to death in a bathtub , walk out of court a free woman yesterday sentence to five year probation .
it take the child three week to die in the hot from -- hospital from the injury it suffer at the hand of its mother and she be free .

the word from serbia , zoran djindjic , the prime minister , be dead .

the morning papers , because morning papers around the country and around the world be remake they front page to include the elizabeth smart case , and we end with that tonight .
with she family on a day when they miracle finally come true .
she look very , very healthy .
she be grow a lot .
and i be just so absolutely thrill .
i could not believe it .
in fact , i have to take a double take and pull she back away from I and say , `` be it really you ? ''
all of the child out there deserve to come home to they parent the way -- the way elizabeth have come back to we .
and i just hope and pray that congress will quickly pass the amber alert so that those child will have a better chance because they cross the state line and they be out of commission .
and we need to have this here .
we really do .
but i just be so grateful and so thankful .

i just bring she little brother william in .
and as william and she see each other , it be such a wonderful reunion for they to just hug , and they -- he would hug she and look at she and hug she and look at she .
and could not believe , i think , as a 4-year-old now that he sister be home .
with the darkness that surround we in these time of the possibility of war that could be come upon we and a miracle that have be bring to we , a incredible miracle that have be bring to we family , word can not express how grateful we be for the prayer around the world .
do miracle still exist ?

that she younger sister , mary katherine , be the one who go to she father and say , `` dad , i think i know who do this . ''
but it take some four month before they be able to get a picture and identify the picture as this brian david mitchell and then he wife , wanda barzee .
the other question , of course , be why do not elizabeth smart try to escae ?
be there opportunity perhaps that she might ab vible to -- able to get away from she abductor ?
the police be say she be abducted by knife point and be a opportunity and may have be some kind of fear factor go on .
we be see a lot locally here some photograph that be come out that show the three , that show mitchell , he wife , and who they believe to be elizabeth smart at a party in september .
there be time perhaps they be in a park somewhere in salt lake city completely robe in these veil and robe so you could not see she face .
there be a lot of question come out about why she could not get away from they , that remain to be answer .
the police be go to be hold a press conference later today .
we be hope to get more detail about that .
you have hear the old say , the best offense be a good defense ?
perhaps with that in mind , the nation 's threat level back at orange , or high , to discourage and thwart potential terrorist attack .
what do this mean if you be travel you might ask .
to cnn 's patty davi at reagan national airport .
what be traveler to do and , for that matter , not to do ?
reporter : mile , what that mean be tighter security at airport across the country .
and that could potentially slow you down .
some thing you may want to do be , first all , just get here a little bit early .
now , homeland security chief tom ridge describe some of those new security measure on top of the one that be already in place .
begin the training for the pilot in the cockpit with firearm .
then you have get the harden cockpit door .
you have training for the flight attendant .
you have more federal air marshal .
you come outside the airline -- the airplane itself and you have technology , 100 % inspection of baggage .
you have new trained inspector for passenger .
you enhance airport security outside the perimeter .
there will be additional random inspection of vehicle and potentially , depend on the airport , some limitation of indegree and egress into the airport .
reporter : airport be currently
back to something kelly wallace say .
she be talk about the somewhat blase attitude of israelis .
we be lack at the front page of the jerusalem post the other day .
the big banner headline that day big and bold , be president bush issue ultimatum .
on the side column , as a afterthought , sit tense tell to carry gas mask wherever they go .
it give you a sense of , perhaps what 50 year of tension and war will do to you mentality .
but it do also say that the israeli be a bit more blase , if that be a fair word for it , than perhaps we be .
president bush , when he talk earlier to reporter , mention that this effort be a effort , this war be a effort to make the homeland , we homeland , more secure .
john king , that whole issue of homeland security must be so much on the mind of so many government official , give the level of the terror alert today .
reporter : so far , so good be the assessment we be get from senior administration official as they try to track what they worry about most .
as we have the strike overseas throughout iraq , there will be retaliatory terror strike , either by organize terrorist network or sympathetic terrorist or people against the united state in this country .
so far , so good .
no plan , we be tell , to raise the threat level , though it be already at orange , which be high .
so microsoft of the president 's business have be behind the scene today .
he be the most senior of about a handful of senior administration official , include the vice president and the secretary of state .
the national security advisor fan out , we be tell in phone call to more than three dozen world leader offer they a update on what be go on .
but we do here hear from the president a bit earlier today .
we see baghdad , a capitol under siege .
mr. bush in the cabinet room at the white house to portray a different image , try to show in washington , it be business as usual , urgent business as , but still business as usual with secretary of defense rumsfeld on one side , secretary of state powell on the other .
the president offer a brief statement in the cabinet room .
call my cabinet together to review we strategy , to make the world more peaceful , to make we country more secure .
to make the life of we citizen as healthy and as prosperous as possible .
we hear from secretary rumsfeld who brief we on the early stage of the war .
there be no question we have set the finest of we citizen into harm 's way .
they perform with great skill and great bravery .
we thank they .
we thank they love one .

we hear from secretary powell who brief we on the ever-growing coalition of the willing , nation who support we deep desire for peace and freedom .
over 40 nation now support we effort .

we want the best of education for every citizen in america .
this cabinet be confident about the future of we country .
we be confident we can achieve we objective .
i be grateful for they service to they country .
thank you all .
reporter : so even at the very early stage of a define moment of bush presidency , the president try to make the case he eye and especially the eye of he cabinet still on the domestic affair of the united state as the early prosecution of the war continue .
one thing the president say that will be the point of contention around the world , the president call it a ever-growing coalition of 40 country .
that be handful more nation that be actively involve in the coalition he father assemble 12 year ago for the persian gulf war , but there be a significant difference , of course .
in this coalition , it ip the united state do the overwhelming load of the fighting .
british force on the ground , australian troops schedule to take part , perhaps in some way .
in the last gulf war , you have arab force on the ground .
the egyptian , syrian , saudi , qatari take up arm to expel the iraqi armiy kuwait .
no such participation this time around .
abc the president say , this be a grow coalition , this be one of the big geo political debate go on around the world as the president
we be watch activity in baghdad .
while we do , we want to tell you marine battle for control of the bridge in the southern city of nasiriyah face stiff resistance from iraqi paramilitary group today .
for some perspective , let 's turn to mile o'brien with retired air force general don shepperd .
thank you very much .
if you be go to fight on the ground , you have to encounter bridge somewhere along the way .
a lot of bridge between where the 3 7 cavalry and the rest of the u.s. force be now and they ultimate destination , downtown baghdad .
we have the city lay out for you here .
how many bridge in this city alone ?
in this map we have right here , 13 major bridge in downtown baghdad , include the expressway bridge over here .
three bridge here attach east baghdad to west baghdad and the palace area .
this be one technique , one possible way u.s. force might seize a bridge , a bridge that might be defend by iraqis .
let 's look at the animation .
typical scenario there .
it do not really matter for this scenario that we be lay out here .
this would be represent m1-a1 tank come towards the bridge firing .
you have to bundle up and line up to go across that bridge .
make it vulnerable to fire from the other side .
potentially chemical weapon , too .
as we turn the other direction , what you will see be these iraqi tank that be kind of fortify there .
they have burn in front of they .
artillery behind they firing back .
and then they there go the smoke screen .
the idea of the smoke screen be to obscure the oncoming force fire ing at you from be able to see .
it do not work , though .
it work both way .
it obscure you but also obscure they .
here be a f-16 .
he come in and want to identify he target and he be get a big -- can not see through the smoke .
we have get some technique we be go to show you .
somewhere near we can put down special
on we go in the meantime .
again , today , there be disturbing hint , and we underscore hint here , that coalition force may soon face a attack use chemical weapon .
yesterday the story center on intelligence regard enemy intention .
today the evidence be somewhat more tangible .
report for we , cnn 's david ensor .
reporter : the evidence be accumulate that iraq may be plan to use chemical weapon .
gas mask turn up in abandon trench .
in nasiriyah in a building mark as a hospital u.s. marine find weapon , atropine antidote kit , and that be not all .
they find over 3,000 chemical suit and gas mask as well as a number of iraqi military uniform .
reporter : the finding be heighten concern among coalition force approach baghdad since , as the iraqis should know , u.s. and british force do not use chemical weapon .
u.s. official say some intelligence indicate a red line may have be draw around the capital with republican guard unit order to use chemical weapon once u.s. and ally troops cross it .
there be also intelligence , official say , suggest republican guard unit have be issue artillery shell contain chemical agent .
there have be intelligence scrap , who know how accurate they be , chatter in the system , that suggest that the closer that coalition force get to baghdad and tikrit the greater the likelihood and that some command and control arrangement have be put in place .
reporter : in baghdad deputy prime minister tariq aziz repeat he government 's stand -- it do not have any kind of weapon of mass destruction .
translator : when they start to talk about the weapon of mass destruction , we know and we always know that that be fabrication and line .
reporter : expert say saddam hussein 's force will likely try to hold out in baghdad for as long as possible without use the weapon he government insist it do not have , hope to build international pressure on the u.s. and britain to back down .
in that sense any use of chemical weapon would be counterproductive to saddam , because it would only galvanize international
for some american who find themselves spend hour on end watch television coverage of the war , it can be hard to break away .
that be especially true if you have a love one in the war zone .
but as we candy crowley remind we , life do and must go on .
reporter : spring-time and a game of catch on the washington mall .
a gentle breeze and a good meal beside the pacific ocean .
that other place , the one on tv all the time , might as well be on another planet .
and that may be the point .
we happen to be at a very nice spot by the beach where this be a chance for people to get away from cnn coverage , everything , and kind of relax reporter : time to redefine normal again , which on the homefront now seem to mean life as you live it only weirder .
i be amaze at how unaffected i be by thing , how i be still come to work and do the same thing and go for a walk in the morning .
and it just seem so strange to I that it be almost a parallel universe .
more than 70 percent of american say they be sad about the war .
the barber at hinsville georgia larry that .
they seem more depressed .
a lot of they afraid they be go to lose they job , you know , the economy be down and all kind of stuff .
life on the homefront seem the same at farmer 's market in lo angele , but it be more angst ridden .
i do not think it be affect we business as much as i be worry that it would , but you never know it be go to happen .
if there be any kind of terrorism that happen here , i think that would definitely put a damper on everything .
nationwide , people shop less in the first week of the war .
sale fall 2 percent from the previous week .
air travel have fall 10 mer since the war begin and some hotel chain say cancellation be up .
60 percent of the people say they be watch the war .
my boyfriend have be watch the tv like every single day , every time it come on , he be watch it .
maybe fewer people be shon because they be watch tv .
maybe fewer be fly because they worry about terrorism or they worry about what the war will do to the economy or maybe it be everything .
there be no one economic statistics to point to a downturn , it be a overall feeling , a psychological feeling that everything be freeze , everything be on hold .
consumer be not spend , people be not buy stock , everything be
tense of thousand of additional u.s. troops be get ready to join coalition force fight the war in iraq .
the first departure be already underway at fort hood texa .
cnn 's jamie kolbe be there report , jamie on these family who be say good-bye to they love one .
reporter : and this be a military town , judy and little by little we be see these soldier head out .
in a strange way and this may sound unusual , there be a little sense of relief because these soldier be set to leave in january and now they get second deployment order , the delay , of course , the inability to get access to turkey , but along the way , the 4th infantry division be one seep in tradition and there be a real sense of pride among the soldier , 250 of which leave yesterday , over the course of the week 12,000 will be leave from here .
another 4,000 from fort carson in colorado and it date back to world war i. they equipment that leave on january be now on a ship on its way south through the suez canal and it be interesting to note some of the equipment that be be hold up for the last couple of month , there be some 5 helicopter , 200 tank as well as 150 bradley infantry fight vehicle .
these be highly train soldier .
they be ready to go .
they be happy to be finally able to come and back up the first wave of troops that leave from here .

judy ?
it be -- i do not think we can say it often enough , jamie .
it be get
today 's battle include picture of the oil field fire in southern iraq .
firefighter continue they work at the ramallah oil field .
official say they cap one blaze , leave only two well still burn out of 500 oil field in the area .
they say some iraqi who work in the field before the war already be ask for they job back .
and these picture show iraqis run for cover just before u.s. plane drop a bomb near northern iraq .
just as they disappear over the ridge , you can hear the plane and the explosion and then you see the cloud .
ask any american marine and they will tell you they will do anything possible to recover the body of fall comrade .
that grim task be carry out by marine engage in the fierce battle for the city of nasiriyah nasiriyah .
aless so vinci be there with the marine .

we be get late word tonight that geraldo rivera may not be be kick out of iraq after all .
originally the central command say the veteran fox news correspond be be expel because he compromise the location of the unit he be be embed with .
now a spokesman from the central command be say and i be quote `` frankly , we have bigger and more important thing to do . ''
during a live broadcast geraldo draw a map in the sand show the location of the unit in relation to baghdad .
say he be not aware he be be expel but say if so , it be because some bitter former colleague of he at msnbc blow the whistle on he .
it sound to I like some rat at my former network , nbc , be spread some lie about I .
you know , they can not compete fair and square on the battlefield so they be try to stab I in the back .
it be not first time .
the central command on the other hand say rivera be be kick out of iraq because `` he give away the big picture stuff . ''

that woman , we believe s marry to one of two journalist who disappear in iraq almost two week ago , both work other for the network , itn .
we have hear that perhaps both be be hold in basra , possibly in a hospital , but there be no way for we to confirm they whereabouts , but obviously a lot of concern from this woman as to where whereabouts of she husband and he health .
walt roger be back with we .
we have be in and out now for almost two hour .
what be happen with you and the 7th cav as we continue to watch you image by way of video phone and the giant m1-a1 tank .
walt , good evening again .
bombardment of baghdad continue tonight and over the past 20 minute , explosion rock baghdad , central baghdad southern baghdad , the outskirts of baghdad , and importantly , as the coalition force , principally u.s. army force , move against saddam hussein international airport -- which be about ten mile outside the center of baghdad -- those explosion be intensify .
if we may again go to the wide screen of what appear to I to be abu dhabi television that be provide this picture , 3:20 a.m. in baghdad , live picture again .
that it be very difficult to discern whether or not that be , in point of fact , the missile that we have become accustomed to striking baghdad and its environs , or whether it be the large 2,000 pound jdam bomb that have be striking target sclect by the coalition in baghdad , or whether these flash now represent artillery barrage as fight continue to take control of the -- to take control of saddam international airport .
again , correspondent , we correspondent with the -- embedded with these force , with they in the field , say in some case they can see the light of the skyline of baghdad .
over the course of the past two week , since this war begin , something like 23,000 coalition sortie have be fly , and over the course of the past 24 hour , 1,900 sortie fly .
and we be tell that , of those , 850 be strike sortie , motor vehicle most of those direct against the republican guard .
as you know , the republican guard just outside baghdad to defend the city and saddam hussein 's regime , in principal .
two of those division absolutely devastate , destroy .
the so-called medina division , and the baghdad division .
the baghdad division , of course , get its name from the fact that it be the republican guard division designate to defend principally baghdad .
four other division we be tell have also be hit very , very very hard and be principally try to reinforce unit va also be hit very hard .
so we be see a lot of what some of the military official be call a method that do not seem to be direct by one person from the center of baghdad .
and that raise question , question that have be in front of we since that first strike on march 19th against the location that the cia military intelligence thought be a place where saddam hussein , perhaps he son , be .
that preemptive strike they put , i think somewhat elegantly , try to strike at the head of the snake .
new explosion rock part of baghdad tonight .
we will continue to monitor that .
we , of course , will bring the word to you just as soon as the army and coalition force do take control of saddam hussein international airport , just on the outskirts of baghdad .
in southern iraq today , british force also move closer to the center of the second largest city in iraq , basra .

the pentagon say the strategy be to seize key objective in and around baghdad .
report suggest airport building have be attack , but runway remain operational .
tonight , a series of large explosion rock central baghdad , as we have be report to you over the course of this hour .
coalition aircraft be hear fly overhead .
it be not clear what the target be .
certainly , some of they near and around saddam hussein international airport although there have be strike in central baghdad as well .
in the course of the past hour .
the army 's 3rd infantry division 1st marine division , lead the assault against baghdad .
the 3rd infantry be approach from the southwest , the 1st marine from the southeast .
armored force destroy dozen of iraqi tank and personnel carrier in they advance on baghdad .
iraqi force use soviet-era tank .
they stand no chance against the m1 abram tank use by army and marine .
central command have determine that baghdad airport be unusable for normal air operation .
the airport , for the most part , be now under u.s. control .
military official will not say whether damage to the runway be go to limit operation there , but they know there be underground bunker there and some other area that may be of use .
centcom also say 2500 republican guard troops have surrender to u.s. marine between kut and baghdad .
military official say the baghdad republican guard division be no longer a effective fight force .
we turn now to a iraqi -- first of all , before we tell you about this story , we be go to , these be live picture from baghdad .
there be be some activity in the last few moment .
look like tracer fire we be look at , anti-aircraft gun firing at what they sense be some sort of threat come from the sky .
baghdad have have sporadic episode of this tonight .
no major explosion we be aware of , but just , apparently , in the last few moment , there have be activity .
you can see it there just now .
we have be report , the city have begin to see its electricity turn back on .
we do not know that all ofist be back , but at least some of it be .
we also know that 12 mile southwest of the city , coalition force remain largely in control of what be formerly saddam hussein international airport , now rename by the coalition baghdad international airport .
but the coalition be quick to point out that they do not have control of the area immediately surround the airport .
again , this be -- these be live picture of baghdad , where it be well into the night .
we be , of course , go to keep monitor the situation there and bring you up to speed on anything we learn .
walt rodger , 3-7th cavalry say iraqi missile hit operation center for 2nd brigade 3rd infantry zrig south baghdad , at least four dead , two soldier and two journalist .
other report at least 15 be wound .
some of they critically , hope to get walt up in a couple minute to get more information on what be happen there .
look at like picture of heir force one now on the ground at a royal air force base outside of belfast , northern ireland .
it be call aldergrove , just outside belfast .
the president of the united state come for a brief two-day summit with the british prime minister tony blair .
they will be talk about a postwar iraq among other important subject .
they will also have a opportunity to review the so-called road map for israeli/palestinian peace negotiation to get off the ground .
they also want to review what the status be of northern ireland right now as that peace process seem to be take hold .
be relatively quiet in northern ireland over the past few year .
this be the third time in as many week that president bush and prime minister blair will be sit down to review station , war strategy , as they go forward together .
go forward as close ally in try to help put together a new iraq .
there be some significant difference in they strategy , include what role precisely the unite nation should have in determine the future of iraq .
they will try to thrash all of that out .
you be look at the picture of air force one taxi in on the tarmac , get ready for the president .
as we watch this picture of the air force one get into this airport i want to bring in we military analyst general dan crisman to go over what happen happen in baghdad .
seem pretty far away from belfast right now , general .
but decision that these two leader make could have a significant impact on the future of iraq .
first of all , general , we will keep this picture up of air force one , talk about what you sense be happen on the street of baghdad right now .
wolf , it be clearly the final phase .
the engame which be unfoaling right now .
i think it be very significant not only in baghdad but basra itself .
you have coalition force there in some strength .
apparently three ba talian of the u.s. 3rd division in baghdad three coalition asset , three huge battle group in basra itself which the u.k. have there , what they have develop here , wolf , over the last several week i very clear and increasingly clear intelligence as to what the final remnant of the regime leadership be in term of where they be embed in the city .
what they be do be go in now , very carefully , obviously some symbolic raid against palace .
but the more important presence be to go after what intelligence deliver and that be where these key leader be located .
they be go to be defend fanatically but intelligence be so crucial from aerial platform and special op personnel to give the three asset the intel which they need to close with and eliminate final remnant of the regime in those city .
this be a very important final phase here , wolf , and it look like the closure be come here now more rapidly than we anticipate .
as we continue to watch air force one , now on the ground outside belfast , northern ireland , we will be watch president bush emerge from the plane momentarily .
we will continue to have live coverage of that .
when walter rodger , we embedded reporter with the 3-7th cavalry say three battalion of troops be on the ground , inside baghdad itself , have take up position they be go to spend the night there presumably , how many soldier be we talk about right now ?
between 700 and 1,000 .
the task force really , wolf be probably build around the m-2 bradley the basic infantry fighting vehicle .
it be the equipment of choice for a task force like this to go into baghdad .
it be cannon , it be ability to implace troops and fire through the firing port in that bradley vehicle to take they in under protection .
it be a very , very important piece of equipment .
these be probably mechanize heavy task force that have overhead aerial platform to provide direct support .
it be significant the degradation of the iraqi air defens have allow a-10 , predator , u-s , other asset to hover and loiter and provide the overhead protection to these task
welcome back n case you be just tuning in , we top story this hour , the discovery of suspect chemical weapon material at a agricultural complex in central iraq .
troops from the u.s. army 's 101st airborne division go to the site on friday , find a number of large drum bury in bunker .
initial test be inconclusive .
the general benjamin frankly of the 101st say today a more sophisticated test indicate the presence of nerve and blister agent .
he say that type of test that be require sometimes show false-positive and further testing will be do to determine whether the material be indeed nonweaponized chemical agent or perhaps simply pesticide .
general frankly say it be hard to believe u.n. inspector would have find the facility hide as deeply as it be near the euphrate river .
we will be much more on this develop story come up in a few minute .

as you probably know , the prime minister of the great britain have be under great pressure at home and much of europe to support give the unite nation a very strong role in stabilize iraq .
the white house have signal consistently it want the united state and great britain to create a lead role .

good to see you .
thank you , paula .
good to see you on a different network for a change .
that be what happen when you sell book .
i know .
let 's talk about what barbara starr be report from the pentagon .
she say there be a acknowledgment from those official that there be not enough ground troops in place and particularly in baghdad to control what we nic robertson be say be a stage of anarchy in some part of iraq .
do you think the administration underestimate the day after ?
i think because the day after come so fast and so suddenly in way .
i think that there be be a pattern here not just with this administration , but over the last ten year , bosnia , kosovo , afghanistan , where we do not quite recognize when the old order collapse , you very quickly have to rush in and fill it with some kind of new order .
in the short-term , that be go to have to mean the american military .
but the key question , which i try to address in the book , be what do you do after that ?
what kind of authority do you create in a society go through this kind of transition .
and how do you know that the local iraqi citizen will make up this government or , in fact , interested in democracy ?
there be no proof of that .
well , the key here be the only way to get that kind of legitimate government to have it look good be to hold election .
but if you hold election , you stop the whole process of build a rule of law , create court , create administration .
we have see in the past in bosnia for example , you hold election and all of the old ethnic thug get into power because they have organization and they have money and they stop the process of genuine building of democracy .
there be this tension here which be the only way to make this look good be in some way get legitimate iraqi authority , but the faster you get that , the more likely you stop this process .
so what do you think of this interim government ?
you get deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz say that american and british military force would play a lead role in set up a iraqi government and then later draw civilian into the process .
be that go to work ?
i think it will work if it be truly broad-based and truly consensual , try and include all different people and include they in create a constitution which would take a few year .
what i point out be the play where you have have quick transition
a michigan teen who disappear with a convict killer and go on a three-week oddysey be in trouble with the law tonight .

-lsb- applause -rsb- d the extra $ 400 per child to american family this year , 2003 .
all together these tax reduction will help 92 million american .
and a significant part of the benefit to we economy will come within the first two year of the plan .
a family of four with a income of $ 40,000 would receive a 96 % reduction in federal income tax .
instead of pay $ 1,178 per year , the family would pay $ 45 a year .
-lsb- applause -rsb- that mean extra money in the family budget year after year .
that money can cover a lot of bill .
that money can help family with purchase they have be delay .
that money will be in circulation , which will be good for we economy .
-lsb- applause -rsb- and this plan will help we small business sector .
the benefit of the growth plan will come from uncreased consumer spending and , as importantly , from a lower income tax rate on the small business themselves .
it be important for we fellow citizen to understand that most small business pay they business tax at the individual rate .
most small business be sole proprietorship , limited partnership , be subchapter ss , and , therefore , when you reduce individual tax rate , you benefit small business formation .
as a matter of fact , under this plan , some 23 million small business owner will see they tax cut .
which leave more money for investment , more money for growth , more money for job creation .
a grow economy also need small business investment .
and we tax code should encourage investment .
today a small business can deduct a maximum of $ 25,000 in the year in which they buy equipment .
we need to triple the amount that can be deduct in the year in which they buy equipment .
-lsb- applause -rsb- so i propose to congress that they ought to limit -- limit ought to be increase to $ 75,000 and that limit ought to be index to inflation .
by do so , we promote greater investment in machinery .
and when a small business bias machine that enhance they company 's product divty as well as it mean machinery manufacturer be likely to have more work available .
more investment equal job .
and what we be interested in in this administration be help people who look for work find a job .
-lsb- applause -rsb- we can also promote economic growth and job creation by remove the double tax on dividend .
-lsb- applause -rsb- tax corporate income once be fair .
it be not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice .
the burden of double taxation fall on the million of individual who receive dividend .
fall especially hard on senior who receive half of all dividend income .
removal of double taxation would put more money in the hand of investor .
it would encourage more investment in american business .
economist say that this plan will help we stock market , and since half of american family own stock , the reform will help they save and help we economy grow .
now , these measure be present to congress in the first week of this year .
the pro growth package be urgent in january .
it be even more urgent today .
-lsb- applause -rsb- it be important for you all to understand and for we fellow american to understand the tax relief that i have propose and will push for until enact would create -- -lsb- applause -rsb- will create 1.4 million new job by the end of 2004 .
in two year time , this nation have experience war , a recession and a national emergency .
which have cause we government to run a deficit .
the best way to reduce the deficit be with more growth in we economy , which mean more revenue to we treasury , and less spending in washington , d.c. -lsb- applause -rsb- i be pleased that both the house and senate have pass budget resolution that show real spending restraint .
and now the congress must focus on a robust and effective growth package .
we need at least $ 550 billion in that package because the more tax relief that go to the american people , the more job we will create in this economy .
-lsb- applause -rsb- the last few month have be a time of challenge for america .
we resolve have be test .
yet we have the great resource of national strength .
and national character .
to overcome every challenge we face .
we confidence a we optimism have never waiver .
we be defend the peace of the world .
we be bring freedom to corner of the world who have not see freedom in year .
we be all build the prosperity of we country .
this be a unique moment in we history and the american people be rise to meet it .
i want to thank each of you for you hard work .
i want to thank each of you for the faith you have show in this country 's future .
may god bless you , and may god continue to bless america .
-lsb- applause -rsb-

the coroner examine the remains of two body recover near san francisco bay yesterday be unable to determine the cause of death .
police be now consider the possibility that the remains be those of laci peterson and she unborn child .
peterson disappear on christmas eve of last year .
paul vercammen join I now from martinez , california , with the latest for we .
paul ?
reporter : well , lou , one thing that the coroner have be able to determine be that the skeletal remains be those of one , a adult female , and two , the remains of the almost full-term baby boy .
and of course , this be significant because laci peterson , when she disappear from she modesto home , be 7 1/2 month pregnant .
that be on christmas eve .
she husband , scott , at the time say that he be fishing in the berkeley marina .
now , in a strange twist in all of this , just yesterday separate from the skeletal remain i allude to earlier a man hike near the berkeley marina find a bone , and they be now look at that as another possible lead in this case .
this person come across the bone at the shore .
he bring it home and contact the authority , and we take possession of it .
and you be try to connect it to the other -- well , we be try to find out if it be a human bone and whether or not it be related to the other .
reporter : and yet another reason why that bone could be a key link , there be report that have surface that in term of the female remain that be find the skeleton be not completely intact .
now this case be also take on a rather , we should say , almost a tv episodic forensic pathology angle because they be go to bring in a expert on what be call alufating decay , and basically this person be go to come in here and look at the body .
this be in the damage aspect of it .
and they say these expert will be able to tell how long the body have be in there and if the remains of the almost full-term baby boy be inside the female 's remain at the time of death .
also , the coroner could know right now but be not say if there be some sort of trauma to either of these skeleton , for example , if they could see the bone compromise in some way they could tell if there have be a stab or a shooting .
we may learn a lot more on this in just 15 minute .
that be because modesto police have schedule a news conference and while they may not say much at all they could also drop some major bomb shell , lou .
report live from martinez , california , i be paul vercamman , now back to you .
paul , let I ask you , if i may , quickly , be we expect -- be there any reason for we to expect that there would be the ability to identify those remain as a result of these autopsy this afternoon ?
reporter : it sound like all of this will be too quick , and it seem underlie all this be there could be a absence of dental record .
that be particularly important for the adult female remain .
so now they be go to have to turn to dna , and that be why they be call in these expert .
some dna testing can be very quick , but sometimes it can take up to week , even more , lou .
okay .
paul vercamman , thank you very much .

am@cnn.com be the address .
unburden yourself .
we will talk more about it with jeff greenfield come up .
we will continue to watch this cramma unfold off key largo in florida .
let 's much on to another important story .
it be happen , of course , several time during the war in iraq , journalist catch in the line of fire and kill .
israeli troops be face a similar situation with two journalist kill in just the past two week .
here 's cnn 's cly wallace .
reporter : friday night in the gaza strip and a journalist be about to lose he life .
shortly after several shot be hear a israeli bulldozer can be see uncover the israeli say , a tunnel use to smuggle weapon .
moment later , three journalist who be cover that israeli action appear .
one with tv label on the back of a bullet-proof vest , another carry a white flag .
judge from the videotape , they appear difficult to see in the darkness .
and difficult to hear .
after the journalist shout , another gunshot .
moment later , another shot and the sound of someone in pain .
34-year-old british journalist jame miller die on the scene after israeli soldier come to he aid , the israeli defense source say .
he be best know for he work on two award-winning documentary which appear on cnn expose the world to the taliban rule in afghanistan .
now the foreign press association in israel be call for a independent investigation .
jame be not shooting and he be not with somebody shooting .
so , again , to know exactly what happen we need a full-fledged inquiry .
the israeli government say its force be return fire and that miller be shoot in the back , suggest he could have be hit by palestinian gunman .
those close to miller believe he be shoot by a armored israeli personnel carrier .
we know the israelis fire .
whether or not he be shoot by israelis gunfire , we be not certain at this time .
miller become the second journalist in just two week to be kill cover the israeli-palestinian conflict .
with palestinian cameraman , shot and kill by a israeli soldier on the west bank in mid-april .
with back-to-back death make a total of at least seven journalist kill cover the conflict in the past two and a half year .
this be very worrying and i believe the israeli army should take special measure to prevent this .
the message from the israeli government be that its soldier be not target journalist , but that journalist who travel to place where there could be live fire exchange between israeli force and palestinian gunman have a responsibility to take greater precaution .
they have to realize that this be not a game go on there .
it be a life and death situation .
soldier be basically think about they own life at that moment .
they do not have time to hesitate .
the israeli spokesman say the soldier he no choice , but to be there .
journalist say

`` vanity fair 's '' come lumist daniel fair be here .
quite in the june edition , he describe the journey .
he say he find evidence that hussein 's day of reckon well over due .
christopher hitchen join we from california .
good to have you with we .
thanks for have I .
you journey , particularly to southern iraq , what be evoke there a sense of both that you evoke be a sense of history of this regime .
give we you insight as to what you think the future hold .
do you mean if i start with the past ?
not at you will .
not at all i. not much of a trip .
i be not up the sharp end .
i be not take risk .
i be not in a position that my dear friend be in when he be kill outside bagdad airport but i have long thought and i be in iraq in the previous war that really all the talk that have be about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , be essentially nonsensical because in 1990 , saddam hussein make the only self criticism .
he say , i could either invade kuwait or finish develop the nuclear weapon .
maybe before the weapon and then later he say , oh , i should have get the nuclear weapon before i invade .
he be right about that .
but that mean that he inaugurate at that point like a dozen-year 's war where the united state could be criticize for do too little and act too slowly but all we be argue about lately be to do with those that should have be finish in '91 when it could have be finish .
should have take the side of the rebel then .
take the risk of support a shiite insurrection at that point .
help the kurd , remove the regime .
absolutely .
we would be 11 year into nation building by now if we would do that .
that seem to be the core of the argument .
as you point out , of course , for the fact of the matter be , the mistake of saddam hussein make possible he removal from power ultimately .
the mistake of the united state , again , as you point out , norman schwarzkopf make a peace , permit helicopter to fly .
still hurt I to read this .
the little town i be in this southern iraq , as far as i get , i can not boast of further , be where the talk take place .
we have the transcript of the meeting .
they say , okay , we have lose this round .
do you mind if we keep you helicopter in the air just to be able to transport thing ?
and he say , yeah , that be all right .
they ask again , be you sure they mean that ?
they can not believe the luck .
they use the gunship to kill , we think , not less than 50,000 inhabitant of southern iraq and try to do that to the kurd , as well , so it be a knife edge .
and it be not just be wise after the event , i believe , to say that there be a argument in realtime between the bush administration member .
mr. cheney 's the only one i know that change he mind .
most of those that take the view at that time , think until recently they be correct in save saddam hussein .
of course , mr. cheney be in the chain of command with swars cough and -- many other .
when they make the decision not to move toward bagdad with bad information .
namely , the republican guard absolutely devastate .
yes .
and , well , we know now the harvest of all that .
it hurt to think of how many wonderful people in iraq at the academic community , lawyer , human rights activist , civilian , intellectual , people -- would now be alive .
who have be horribly murder and tortured and reduce to misery since by a half application of violence through sanction and overflight .
mistake make then , mistake part of human experience , but now we have a opportunity not to make mistake .
be it you sense that the united state be on the right track ?
that there be the prospect here a commitment here on the part of the united state to
the slogan make for a powerful bumper sticker -- gun do not kill people , people do !

nike be hope the phenom will help boost they sale of basketball shoe to that crucial team market .
and of course everybody be get a opinion whether the kid be go to skip college and go right into the pro , worth this kind of money .
this be mega buck .
they only pay tiger wood $ 40 million for he deal come out of stanford university .
but he have a amateur golf career where he post score and do thing comparable to what be do on the pga tour .
nobody know if this kid can play against shaquille o'neal or not .
nike and nba be look for the next big thing .
it be not only of course he basketball skill , which be unquestionable .
but he personality .
then if in fact the team he ultimately play on , whether the cleveland cavalier , or somebody else , whether they actually be any good .

i can not , that be my point .
they have the lowest attendance in the nba .
i check it out .
this guy ,
as we say , earlier this week , christine todd whitman step doup and now a whole lot of analysis be take place as to why she step down , the job she be do when she be in office and the job that have yet to be complete .
from we new york bureau as i be introduce a moment ago , dan fagen , the environment writer for news day and dan , whitman do consider herself sort of the republican environmentalist .
but now there be be a awful lot of monday night quarterback quarterback take place now that she be tep down .
what do you suppose take place here ?
i think many people have watch thisstration in action and watch chis tee whitman in action .
the mystery be that she take the job in the first place or do not leave earlier .
she be quite a misfit for this administration , and she show that over and over .
she be not good at all at communicate the administration 's message to the public and certainly to the environmental group and she be even worse at bring the epa bureaucracy , the epa environmental policy maker ' message to this administration because she see herself undercut over and over .
that be interesting because lead into it , while she be new jersey governor , she sue the epa and she be very much consider herself to be a environmentalist , and then only to end up become the head of the epa and then of course , there be a lot of criticism over relax regulation .
let 's hear what she have to say last wednesday here on cnn just after announce she resignation .
i be not leave because of clash with the administration , in fact , i have not have any .
i report to the president , and he have always ask I to give he my best unadulterated advice .
we have have be on the same page .
i be never supportive of protocol because it do not do what everyone need to get do as far as climate change be concern .
i be leave now because it be the appropriate time to do it .
dan , do you agree with that ?
she say the appropriate time .
do you suppose for personal reason or perhaps she be out of step with the administration ?
i be sure that it be difficult for she personally , but i think the commuter marriage perhaps would have be less stressful if everyday she do not see herself be undermine and overruledd .
i mean if christy whitman and the white house be on the same page , i do not think i have see a book large enough to contain a page that big .
over and over there be many , many instance over the last
let 's talk a little bit more about what the navy do to prevent such tragedy .
we be talk about it this morning and we put together some graphic for you .
i will try to explain it the best i can from what i remember from be on the `` uss abraham lincoln '' this be a amphibious ship , rather , but this be what the navy do with regard to prevention .
everybody that be , every sailor that be enterse the navy do take a swim test .
they learn how to tread water and do the dead man float and they have to pass that in order to continue on .
also drill take place before sailor get on to any ship , before any deployment , usually twice a day , they be practice man overboard drill , know where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard take place and as the deployment begin , those wane off , but they know where to go quickly .
they also wear float coat .
you can see they here .
the yellow shirt be wear a yellow float coat .
everything be color coordinate .
you see the gentleman here wear a brown one and they have toggle to pull and inflate .
they also have a manual device so if the toggle do not work they can blow air into the inflation device .
they have dive goggles and they be able to find they .
it also have a strobe light and a whistle .
also such location device , some ship have smoke float they can toss out so the man overboard will be able to use smoke signal as a way of try to find or locate , let the rescuer locate they .
also 24/7 there be individual on watch .
all throughout the ship , all around the ship .
and indeed , there be net on most part of the ship , not on entire all around the entire ship , but on most part there be a very thick net .
now let 's talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there be a man overboard situation .
you will hear a p.a. announcement around the entire ship .
there be a man overboard so everyone know they have to react quickly .
a ship-wide search will happen f. they do not see that person go overboard , but if indeed they do see someone go overboard , the ship start to circle that area continuously .
also small boat sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , helicopter be launch immediately .
inside those helicopter rescue imswimmer .
if indeed the man overboard be located , well the hoister be drop down with usually a torso harness .
if the man overboard be injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those swimmer will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull they up into the helo and pull they back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search take about 24 hour .
the search crew will go 24 hour before call off that search .
why call it off ?
there be a number of reason to look at .
depend on the water temperature , it be very possible that or very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .
also the reason for the 24-hour search be they fail they have exhaust all resource by that time .
anyway , we will continue to follow what be happen on the `` uss nassau '' as those investigation continue for the two miss sailor .
night open on the `` uss john c. stennis . ''
on this deployment they primarily fly after dark so the ship 's schedule be upside down , the crew sleep by day and work all night .
this be day two of war time operation for the `` stennis '' and `` operation iraqi freedom . ''
for the next 12 hour into the morning , plane from the carrier will fly mission over afghanistan .
there be only a faint orange light on deck , punctuate by this .
to adjust they eye for night vision , crew member make they way through passageway glowing in dim red light .
on the flight deck , a walkover check for debris be light only by flashlight .
the danger of the flight deck be blow overboard by jet , slight slice by propeller or other hazard that be hard enough to avoid in daylight be all the more intense at night .
the intricate coordination of launch and recovery play out as a dance in the darkness .
the complexity of it all have be describe as a ballet and if it be a ballet , the choreographer of the flight deck be this man here .
he be the handler .
adrenaline be high on the flight deck of this carrier at war .
soon after dawn on this fourth day , confirmation of the ship 's first strike .
fourth day of combat operation today bear fruit for the air wing and the ship team here .
we have f-14 aircraft drop laser-guided bomb , f-18s drop joint direct attack munitions or j-dam weapon into eastern afghanistan today this be the first of a unknown number of strike we will conduct during we watch in `` operation enduring freedom . ''
they will come back high fiving and feeling pretty good about it but it be a bit of a somber event that they be go through out here .
but the biggest thing you be see be the intensity .
reporter : the fighter jet drop they ordnance in a coordinate atack on a convoy near the afghan city of choft .
the pentagon say the convoy be taliban and al qaeda troops .
there be a attack on a convoy of leadership that be identify through various intelligence mean .
that be do within the last 24 hour .
reporter : but the strike prove controversial .
local afghan in the convoy say it be a group of elder on they way to the inaugural ceremony for interim afghan leader hamid karzaus .
analyst believe some tribal warlord may have take advantage of american firepower by accuse ing rife aal leader of be taliban and misguide u.s. intelligence .
the consequence of injure or hurt someone who be friendly or nonparticipant in combat be very difficult to deal with .
a. and we go extreme detail in -- and do a lot of training as well to make sure that do not happen .
we have drop ordnance today .
and i be sure we will continue to drop ordnance .
and do it with precision , do it with accuracy , and do it on call when need first time every time .
holy , holy , holy reporter : as the `` john c. stennis '' end its first week of operation in the arabian sea , christmas be only a few day away .
though a choir rehearse in the chapel for a christmas event , for the crew , it be another workday , they first day off will not be for another three week .
it be another day for I .
when i be out here , i do not look at a calendar , i do not think about it .
i stay busy at work .
reporter : but there be other chance for the smip to gather like this moment of pride to honor sailor who earn a promotion in rank .
it be call a frocking ceremony .
there be a sense of respect that you will agree as you walk around this crew be there .
as they take care of one another the whole community come together they follow together as a team or they win together as a team .
and i always encourage they to take care of themselves .
because if they do not care of themselves , then it kind of all fall apart at the seam .
reporter : last time we see this sailor he be wash dish in the ghalus .
now he be be promote .
and pilot sarah `` clutch '' joiner and russ `` glady '' knight say they final good-bye .
goggles down , let 's go .
reporter : before board a cargo flight off the `` uss stennis . ''
they will be home in time for christmas .
i have be here for four and a half year .
it be probably time to go .
but i be go miss they .
they be pretty much my family right now , or my family away from my family .
reporter : savor every last minute on the ship , commander knight rush to the flight only seconds before the door close .
have be the best tour of my life .
19 year in the navy , it have be the best tour of my life .
reporter : for the rest of the crew , there be five more month to go in this deployment .
and no one know how long america 's new war on terrorism will keep the `` uss john c. stennis '' engage in battle .
on highest alert as a carrier at war .
we continue with the pride and professionalism we have show to date , we can not do anything but be successful .
please make sure you take care of you ship , take care of yourselve ,

he serve less than nine year .
maryland be the only state that allow unchecked judicial reconsideration , allow judge to reduce prison term at any time after sentencing .
those favor the rule say it give convict incentive to behave in prison and enable judge to release prisoner if new evidence come to light .
at some point after he release , michael serious befriend a woman name darlene williamson .

not everyone be convince .
they could very well be biological weapon production facility , but i do not think the intelligence community have make a open and shut case .
reporter : the cia-pentagon report admit the truck be not a efficient way to produce biological weapon , but official argue the point for the iraqis be to produce some and not to be catch do it .

that stand ovation that sammy sosa get at wrigley field last night .
a major league baseball official be skilledd to conduct interview in chicago .
those interview could be a factor as the league decide how sammy sosa will be punish for use a court-filled bat .
we gary tuchman be live .
good morning .
reporter : the cub 's player this afternoon , once again , sammy sosa will be in the lineup but he could find out as early as today what he punishment will be and how many game he will be suspend for .
last night when he go to play for the first time , most of the fan on wrigley field give he a standing ovation .
in all fairness , not all of they totally believe sammy sosa but he be a hero here and they want to believe sammy sosa .
he hit the ground ball on the first inning , that score a run , but the run be take away .
sosa be quick out of the game after he be find out he have a cork during the bat .
he mean not to use it during the game , but he do use it during the game .
major league baseball take 76 of he bat and x-ray they for cork .
those x race be negative .
that be conduct by a trained radiological technician .
we believe the x-ray process be sufficient to determine the state of those bat and we be very confident that all of those bat be clean and have no foreign substance within they .
it be a mistake .
we be all human and we all make a mistake .
nobody 's perfect in this world upon .
reporter : last night with the bat , we assume be not cork , sammy sosa strike out the first three time up .
he do hit a single in the ninety inning in a lose effort for the chicago cub .
back to you .
there be a concern with the huge series there this weekend with the yankee come to town that sammy would be suspend during that .
the yankee vpt be to wrigley field since the 1930 since they play the cub in the 1930 .
sosa could get a suspension , but he could appeal suspension .
so if he want to play against the yankee , he probably will be able to .
gary tuchman in chicago .
thanks so much .
let 's bring jack back in with the question of the day and bill 's also join we from d.c. .
hello , william .
over you shoulder , jack .
keep a eye on we .
martha stewart unfairly single out for prosecution or be she get what she deserve ?
jim in new york , i have des piesed martha stewart for year before the imclone scandal , but all this prosecution do be how bias prosecutor be when they deal with mogul who strip the hope of investor .
ceo , sleaze walk free , market should be free to stroll right along with they into the ceo hall of shame .
joe in michigan , prosecute , when you skit in life be profess trust and integrity and you violate that responsilibity to you believe public , then you should be do .
jude nith florida , say eye never like martha , but now she be a part of good
all lumber , no filler .
that be the verdict after baseball official x-ray sam why sosa 's entire inventory of bat and find no evidence of cork or any other substance .
that seem to support he contention that the bat get he eject tuesday night be a fluke .
still a decision on what , if any punishment he will face in the wake of that incident tuesday night .
gary tuchman standing by in chicago , with the latest on the sosa saga outside of wrigley field .
reporter : leon , hello to you .
three hour from now the chicago cub take the field against the tampa bay devil ray here at wrigley field and sammy sosa will be out there with they but how long will he ?
we could find out today .
he punishment , suspension for use a corked bat for use -- which be illegal during a game .
since the incident 33,000 fan in the stand for a night game he receive a standing ovation from almost all of they .
i hear a few boo but almost everyone standing .
not everyone believe this man 's story , which be it be a mistake but he be a hero here .
these people want to believe he story .
it happen tuesday night .
in the first inning he hit a ground ball .
score a run .
when he hit the ball , the bat break .
the umpire find cork in the bat .
it be illegal because when you put it in the bat it make the meat lighter .
they hollow out the bat and stick the cork in there to mask the hollow sound .
then you can swing it lighter and you can swing it faster .
they take 76 of he bat for analysis .
they x-ray the bat .

welcome back to `` people in the news . ''
the intifada , the spontaneous 1987 palestinian uprising against the israeli occupation , herald the rise of the muslim fundamentalism .
in what have be a mostly secular palestinian movement .
the most popular of these group hama , a acronym for islamic resistance movement .
in english it mean zeal , its aim -- the destruction of israel .
hama be a islamic movement .
at the very beginning , it be encourage by israel because they think it be a counter weight to palestinian nationalism which be , of course , a secular movement .
hama be found in 1988 by a blind paraplegic cleric who be influence by the islamic muslim brotherhood , with backing from israel , he set up sharity in the improverished strip in the 1970 .
slowly it become more and more politicize , and more and more extreme in its demand for a islamic state .
the extremism take the form of suicide bombing and terrorist attack .
but hama have already become a important part of palestinian society through its charity work and its influence increase over time by provide community service when the palestinian authority do not .
hamas play on the palestinian authority 's failure to produce .
its basic message , the palestinian authority be corrupt , it fail to deliver , hama be not corrupt .
hama care about the person on the street and it do deliver .
unfortunately , those same charitable organization , those same charity committee that funnel the fund to needier palestinian , also serve to support terrorist attack .
israel and the united state say arafat have not be tough enough on terrorism , and have attempt to force he out of the current peace process .
the prime minister know as abu mazen must now contend with the rejection of side by side palestinian and israeli state .
a cornerstone of the new peace plan .
he be try to get hama to co - exist with israel .
conservative israeli be skeptical .
he be not work against hama , he be work in tandem .
he be negotiate with they .
he be not tell they to disband and regulate they weapon , so i have no faith in the ability of abu mazen to put terror aside .
reporter : settler call the just conclude israeli-american - palestinian summit a surrender , and be not impressed .
translator : the armed intifada must end and we must use and resort to peaceful means in we quest to end the occupation and the suffering of the palestinian , and the israelis , and to establish the palestinian state .
hama and other palestinian militant group reject abba ' call to end they attack with a deadly raid on a israeli army outpost in gaza .
we be all say that the resistance will continue despite the summit in aqaba .
israel retaliate on hama , namely al-rantissi , it miss he and kill civilian .
translator : hama will not drop we weapon , even if all leader be assassinate .
reporter : since the second intifada begin in 2000 , over 700 israeli have be kill , during the same time there have be more than 2,000 palestinian death accord to the red crescent .
include hama leader target for assassination .
if you want a end to terrorism , if you want a end to violence , you have to give people hope and you have to give they a stake in the political process .
i think that hama be ready to join the political process , however , if the only price for the political price be you must fight hama , if that be what they be require abu mazen to do , they be almost mandate that he will fail .
the main test of mahmoud abba , will be to establish a overall command of all armed group , if not , it do not have a chance .
you know , leader have to do thing

anyone who know I know my obsession with tween star .
they be kid eight to 14 , and for million , they hero be barely occupy puberty .
the reason for my obsession be simple , deep seething jealousy .
it be not enough for these tween star to be on the tv or movie .
they want to own every form of media and want to own it now .
unlike the corey feldman of the '80 , today 's tween be not content with succeed in just one of medium .
mary indicate and ashley olsen start it all .
now they have a billion dollar empire build on video , clothing perfume and more .
and then there be the tween hilary duff , fan know she as lizzie mag wire .
movie , book , album .
three corporate giant head the way .
typical , nickelodeon or disney start they off .
then when they be ready to breed they go to the wb .
why such a focus on these tween star ?
it have little to do with they artistic vision .
one star tell vanity fair they favorite author be whoever write the bible .
these kid be at that magical age when new multibillion declare spend power be put in service of intense peer pressure lead to brand loyalty that can last a lifetime .
the flip side between star , though , be once the fan grow up they star power may dim .
do not believe in just ask one of the corey .
these tween be everywhere .
they be right on the cover of vanity fair .
tween be all over it .
that be the issue right there .
so we have with we vanity fair fashion director elizabeth olsen .
i be shock when i see they cover the tween .
why be they so important ?
they be important because we report on what be happen .
we report on the culture of what be now , what maze money , what the buzz be , what be next .
and they be make a lot of money .
a much more than a lot of money .
unlike star of the past , they really be not content to be singer or dancer , they be like omnimedia , mini martha stewart .
they be more than that , actually , because they have a television show to back themselves up , then the movie , then the clothing line .
they have much more and reach a much broader audience as well .
i see one interview , and they say , yeah , when i leave the cosby show at age four , i cut a album at age five .
what happen happen to be kid ?
that be the great thing about the photo shoot .
thee still young , ambitious , excited , they play dressup and have pillow fight .
who be the ultimate tween ?
i would have i to say you have to talk about hilary duff , and you have to talk about the olsen twin .
because the olsen twin start it all .
they create it , maybe .
they more than start it .
and they start prenatal .
but they turn it into a empire , what shirley temple could have do .
have she only known .
i think they company be call dual star , like a gross of a billion dollar last year .
they work hard .
they be not just sit there hire people to do they business .
they do they own business , and they be well-rounded and polite people .
be they nice ?
they be so nice and cool .
how about that ?
they be actually very , very cool .
i be not sure of that .
and hilary duff be a star , and i guarantee you , they will grace they own cover .
do they all have stay power ?
one can not predict that all have it , but some have it .
it depend on who be manage it , what career choice they make , what they parent help they to do .
it would be interesting to see the audience that sort of adore they now , whether
welcome back .

`` the lo angele time '' report that israeli and palestinian official may be very close to reach a deal for security control , not just of a small part of gaza , but return all of the gaza strip to palestinian control , that be a very significant step , indeed , plus the west bank city of bethlehem .
the `` l.a. time '' report that negotiation continue and will resume tomorrow .
senior israeli official tell cnn that the size of the area to be return to the gaza strip be not so much the question confirm that , in fact , return all of the gaza strip to palestinian security control be one of the option the israeli have indeed put on the table , the issue be the palestinian readiness and willingness to be able to implement full security control throughout all of the gaza strip .
now , from the israeli perspective , that also mean they would expect palestinian authority to fairly quickly begin to disarm and dismantle organization like hama in particular .

buckingham palace release he picture of william , brother harry and they father , prince charle in what some see as a skilled marketing campaign to sell the monarchy to the next generation of britain .
after 15 year of scandal and embarrassment , many see prince william as the house of windsor 's only hope .
it be the young people he need to appeal to .
by the time he get to the throne , it be go to be in 40 year , the young people of today that need to be he fan .
reporter : william do not lack for fan .
those who weep when he mother , princess di anna , die , apparently transfer they affection to she eldest son .
he be part teen idol , part king in the making , but unlike he father , prince charle , who be likely to precede he to the throne , this prince sustain -- disdain be call you royal highness , sign he name , william wale .
i would think that if you ask anyone if william be normal , every single person would say , absolutely normal .
but slightly more serious than most young man he age .

the nasa and the european space agency both launch mission to mar this month send rover and ashter to probe the red planet .
one of the big question about mar be when or whether human will ever be able to visit .
it be a idea plague with unsolved problem .
the latest issue of `` popular science magazine '' take a look at the challenge nasa be face .
join we be the contribute editor .
good to see you , jeff .
thank you .
it be only about 30 year ago when we go to the moon .
so what be the difficulty in be able to go to mar ?
it be unimaginably difficult and different .
mar be at most time 100 million mile away from we .
it be a nine-month trip .
then if we stay there for about a year or two , the whole trip could last about three year .
we be talk about condition where there be radiation in space cosmic radiation that could cause cancer .
the communication condition once you be on mar , just to talk to people on earth , there be a 20 minute delay in the conversation .
so the -- you know , the issue be so much larger than go to the moon .
and for now , it be 250 day , which seem to be the maximum for astronaut in space anyway .
but as you say , it be a much further travel .
but let 's talk about some of the hurdle that hamper human to be able to survive there .
the dust , for one thing .
cataract another .
let 's talk about the right kind of spacecraft that would be able to allow human to actually get that far and to survive .
right .
well , first of all , the spacecraft would not be launch from earth .
you would have to launch be from in space already , which mean we would have to build it in space .
so that mean we need a good shuttle that be go to take we back and forth to build the spacecraft .
then we have to come up with the fuel that will take it out of the earth 's orbit all the way to mar .
that be probably go to be nuclear propulsion at this point again something we have not really develop yet , because we could not carry that much fuel , obviously .
liquid oxygen would be way too heavy to carry all the way to mar .
the bigger issue be once we get there , we can not carry oxygen or water or food to stay there three year , so we be go to have to do all of that on the surface of the planet .
and think of it .
mar be carbon dioxide .
so we can not breathe there .
so we be go to have to come up with some conversion technique to create water , to create oxygen and then some way of grow food on the planet itself .
all of this be in the work now , but i think it be go to take quite a few year to develop it .
you talk about the cosmic radiation .
then of course there be the zero g bone loss , almost like the erode of bone to human that would be at risk as well .
absolutely .
there could be as much as 50 % bone loss in astronaut in mar .
why ?
during the time in mar .
because when the body have -- when there be no dpravity as there be on mar , the body do not pick up the calcium in the bone , so it do not keep get the bone stronger and stronger .
so they will just lose it .
they will be almost like old people even at the age of 40 .
jeff rothfeder .
thank you for join we .
look like it will be some time before we make we way to mar .
that be it for we .
but before we go , a look at what be come up next week .

Bill hello .
Alexander Hi , this be Alexander from Minnesota .
Bill yeah , I be Bill from , uh , Tampa , Florida .
Alexander hey , g - interesting topic .
Bill yeah .
Alexander Eh , what kind of job do you do , sir ?
what do the work at you place ?
Bill Well , actually , I be self employ .
and I , uh , what I do be I -- whole sale -- car .
so , I I really do not have any worker , I just -- work by myself .
uh , I guess -- I just have one that help I once in a while to pick up car and -- deliver they .
but , uh , that be uh -- interesting that they call I on that .
Alexander so you guy -- but what kind of culture do you have if you work two people work , that should be some sort of every place have Bill but Alexander the atmosphere of , you know , how thing be do , who be in command and how , you know , decision be make , and Bill Right .
and they also do say that , uh , previous work place , too , so Alexander yeah .
okay , wh - uh I I Bill I can talk about that .
where wh - Alexander go a - go ahead , you can talk about you previous work place .
Bill yeah , wh - -- yeah , I be go to ask you where you work , too .
Alexander I work with a pharmaceutical company .
I we -- have a little over three hundred and some -lrb- -lrb- million -rrb- -rrb- employee .
Bill oh wow .
and what do you do there ?
Alexander you know .
I work as a patient care advocate .
and I -- I work as a onli - I do online , you know , online , uh , pharmaceutical company -- where I have -- fill and -- refill take order send back to we online .
Bill oh , okay .
that be interesting .
Alexander and , you know , and I have a company , as well , set up .
I think we have the account manager , and we have -- the vice president .
we have super - team lead - team lead , uh I and then have operation specialist .
we have , you know , I -- team manager , training manager .
it be a very big company .
yeah , and I think that the atmosphere be very good , I Bill Right .
Alexander yeah .
Bill Well , I think that be important to to have a good atmosphere and also , uh , uh , i - know who who really be in charge , uh , you know , and and know who you have to answer to .
because sometimes , y - I I I do I year ago I have a company that be , uh , it be , uh , I be a sub - s - captive sub-contractor for make packaging material .
and , um , there be a lot of salesman in the company , they have a tendency to , you know , there be there be , uh , a chain of command , you might say .
you know , there be , uh , the person that be the , uh , head of the organization .
but , all the salesman -- use to come around and give order , too , you know .
so it make it kind of difficult for the m - for my employee , because they would the salesman would be come out , uh , uh , without consult with the one that be in charge .
they would just be come out and give order when they should already go through he .
so it make it difficult .
so I I I think it be really important to h - have that really clear .
that that there be some organized way to deal with , uh , problem and order and thing like that , and if there be a problem , then -- you go to the person who be in charge and -- then they can handle it .
so , that be -- that that be just a you know , a -- previous , uh , type of work that I have .
and I and tha - I think that be what they want we to talk about , too , right ?
Alexander yeah .
yeah , that be that be that be I think it be just basically , be -lrb- -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- one of the thing I perceive be if - what kind of , you know , environment be it , and be it invite be it , you know , all that they I guess that be what they be aim at .
you know , it be not a place where everybody try to give instruction and everybody try to do , you know .
uh , but I for my job be i - i - -- we have we a very diverse feel .
we have a lot of people who be from different country , and , you know , and -- I think they be pretty much accept , and I , you know , I - bas - basically you - you can promote yourself if you do a good job , I mean , they do not pick and choose , you know .
Bill Right .
Alexander it be a very -- environment that allow you to grow in .
and I think they think I rightfully do not , if -- like if I have a problem , like , I will freshly go to my team lead or the supervisor and she take it to she boss , and , you know , the boss take it to the next level and , you know , something like that .
Bill Right .
yeah , but that -- I feel like that that be very important .
uh , for a company to be well-run , it have to have , uh , a c - it be t - have to be able to send a clear message -- as to how to handle problem and who who be the one that be uh , uh , indicate for -- for those problem -- to handle .
and and people -- those in the company need to be um instruct -- to know wh - where they relative place be in the company .
so that they they do not overstep they bound .
Alexander yeah .
Bill because when that happen , and it that make , uh , that create problem for the employee .
it make they discontent .
I mean , if they if they can be , eh , um , you know , jump on arbitrarily by just about anybody , then pretty soon , you know , they be they be they be not go to be content at all , they be just go to wonder , well when when 's the next hit go to come , you know .
when 's somebody else go to jump on I ?

I do not know where he come from .
a he be the governor of , he be the governor of Pennsylvania .
b oh , that be right .

a and um after uh b now I remember .

a uh Secretary 's position for he , or for someone , but he be the person at that time .
I just think that b yeah .
yeah .
a it be so soon -- since nine eleven , and he have be create he own job , i - in essence , because it be such a new position .
but , I think it be -- it would have be -- better to have one person -- like continue that .
however , b I do too .
I I do too .
I hate to I hate to change -- change horse there so quickly .
a yeah .
b uh I I I would that -- that -- job uh uh need continuity -- for a while .
anyhow .
you know , I m - I mean , at least until they get a yeah .
b settle on what the job really be .
a yeah , well uh maybe maybe on one hand -- somebody new will bring a new perspective to it , which would -- be helpful , but I still think that b uh yeah a the people that be up for it -- there be some p - b yeah , but if it be if the perspective be too new , you know , that be not go to be a good thing , because uh wholesale change be not what they need to do .
a yeah .
yeah .
b uh uh no matter who take it over .
they need to they need to -- think long and hard before they start make change .
because if they make one wrong one , you know , it a but there be there be a couple woman up for -- the position as well as um you know , a few man that be up for the position .

Um -- one -- two of the man be from New York , one be a Head of -- the the -- who be there at nine eleven .
he be the Chief of Police .
or the Commissioner -- of of police I guess .
Uh who be with Giuliani throughout the whole thing .
b uh-huh .
a um they be also think about Giuliani , so -- I mean , I think they have some qualify candidate .
b yeah .
a however , I think -- with it be Homeland Security , which mean it can not just be New York , which be where of course , they focus be go to be .
b sure .
a have -- you know , be there , and through that .
so , as long as they do not have blinders on , you know , I would be okay with that , but they have get to look , obviously -- at port -- nuclear power plant , you know , and oth - other area where we be vulnerable .
b yeah .
yeah , and you know what be really scary to I ?
I I do not I have never see it mention , I have never -- but -- but if they really want to to I do not know uh uh uh if they if they really want to put -- fear in the american people , uh -- I know it would work with I , be if they say just uh if if -- I say they , Bin Laden , or who whoever -- uh -- uh be run that team now , uh be to -- be to just pick a small -- Mid - american town , a Mhm .
b uh and just wipe it out , a yeah , no , and I I thi - I think that be a great fear .
b you know , and there be a lot of way -- there be a lot of way to do that .
I mean , I mean , it would not take a nuclear weapon .
a No , no .
b uh uh and it it could be do so easily because i - i - most small town be protect by a small town police force .
a Mhm .
b you know ?
and that be it .
A Well , I think that -- there be -- really -- be a strengthening , and I hope they can -- get it together without this .
part of the problem with that be the ~ CIA and the ~ FBI and who be go to be in charge because they want to create this new position .
b -lrb- -lrb- I -rrb- -rrb- no , they have always a and , so nobody want to -- give up -- power b yeah .

I have not I have not really think about it .
I -- Colin Powell do not surprise I .
Ashcroft surprise I a little bit um but um I sort of start to think he might step down because evidently he be be he be consider somewhat of a lightning rod for um you know some of he more controversial stand and stuff so .
Sherri Uh-huh .
Ron but and and so have you be follow the uh the propose nominee ?
I mean do you think Sherri Kellogg , the Kellogg guy .

uh-huh , uh-huh .
Sherri way way way more than we realize .
Ron yeah , I I think you be probably right and I think it -- maybe even particularly true under this President , although I do not think it be just limit to he .
I think it be a common problem in the ~ US .
Sherri I f - -- I uh I think i - i - it be uh more evident now than ever .
Ron Uh-huh , uh-huh Sherri you know , really um -- tremen - tremendously a ruling and reign .
Ron do you um Sherri I think it it be a global uh have a global effect .
Ron yeah .
Sherri I think that be why Al-Qaeda -- take down the the uh twin tower .

the the police kind of change they tactic and , because there be a lot of -- oh -- run down area , and a lot of crime and they , you know -- get -- clean it up , and and -- they pass some law that say , you know , you could not , I think it be like , um -- you know , like homeless people that -- carry -- uh -- you know , shop cart , or something like that , and it sound -- small -- to outlaw that .
but they outlaw that because they say a lot of people be steal stuff .
they would stick they in the shopping cart and push they down the road .
you would not know , oh , they be just a homeless person .
well they cut that out and they find out -- it cut down on the theft .
uh -- I guess people -- hide they in they basket and -- or take something and then stick in they basket and the police never -- you know , bother they .
well , the homeless people -- I guess , they need they shopping cart , so they kind of go elsewhere , so -- um -- I mean it be a small thing , but it be , they just figure out , they be -- you know , uh -- learn from experience on what they need to do in the -- city and -- I think he would be a good -- candidate for the Homeland Security , run that .
b but , eh , for the foreign po - uh this be all all what you be say be like , about the internal -- but what about the external policy or something like that ?
whom do you think would be suitable ?
a the what now policy ?
b like , eh , foreign po - or international policy or external or a mhm .
b uh , whom do you think -- would be suitable for this position ?
a to run foreign policy ?
Um -- like , uh -- well , it be -- Colin Powell be Secretary , be he Secretary of State ?
be that what that be ?
b yeah .
a and Condoleezza Rice be go to step into that position , the way I understand it , uh .
b yeah , that be right .
a yes .
you know , she may be -- uh uh uh , you know , uh -- a uh Bush yes person , you know , I do not know , uh b yeah , so I I do not think this will change too much I mean .
a well mo - most -- most -- aide to the President , if it be -- you know , I guess when it be Clinton it be , they would probably be kind of yes people too , but , I mean they pick the person to -- you know , help they and I guess they be go to have to have -- philosophy and and -- run it the way they would or way they would want , uh b yeah , actually I agree with you .
I think uh -- during , uh , Clinton time uh -- the uh like international policy or the external policy be -- be much better than -- uh what what be happen right now , so .
I think if we take Bill Clin - Bill Clinton as like , as a foreign policy -- he he would be he will do a very good job .
I I would say .
a Mhm .
b uh , do you think there be uh -- some other , uh like -- position have to be have be -- have to be create , like uh -- for the next election .
a I be s - -- say that again .
I do not understand .
b I mean , I mean , be there any other , eh , position or -- Uh , like uh , have to be create like the -- uh -- election .
I mean -- uh , for example they they make , uh -- a position for like , uh -- internal eh , security -- I I think after , eh September eleventh a mhm .
b they create a position like that .
do you think there be -- some other position have eh have to be create ?

I think -- I think Rudy Giuliani be a great mayor -- for nine eleven .
a Right .
b I do not think he be a great mayor the whole time he be a mayor .
A Well , I I be a new Yorker , and I get to tell you that I I think nine eleven I I think -- basically make he .
other than that , I think he be a little too decisive .
b yeah .
a uh not I should not say decisive , too divisive .
b yeah , I think he a as far as -- the race relationship in this city .
you know , it do not take much to to please -- the other side .
and that and that be what government be all about .
b no , it do not .
a and he -- he be not -- he be not too much of a good uh b he he would have go out as a mediocre mayor have it not .
and I but even even say that I can not begrudge he .
but he do a great job in the crisis .
some people do better in crisis .
a yeah .
exactly .
exactly , exactly , I I think that nine eleven make he and b yeah .
a and at that point in time , he want to stay on , which be sort of sort of ridiculous .
b and if if if I do not think the rest of the country know that , because they do not know what he do before nine eleven , because they do not pay any attention .
a eh -- exactly .
exactly , of course , you be right , you be quite right .
b and -- I think that if he do get a government agency , it would have to be one that be have crisis a lot of time I mean , he would just have to devote himself to that .
if he could just do that , it would be fine .
a it be a good point .
b but if he get if get into a lot of policy making and stuff that for other thing , you know , a yeah , yeah .
yeah , I I I I know I one of the b I do not know .
probably would be a good attorney general , he do that a it could very well , he do a good job , you be right , he probably could follow in what be he name 's footstep .
b you know .
I think I think the case that he pick and choose probably I would not necessarily put on top of the list , but he do seem to a right .
b prosecute everybody evenly .
a yeah .
that much I think we can we can probably agree with .
he will probably do that evenly .
b yes .
right .

I mean , you know , you just b no .
a pick people who I think will uh -- have the experience in government .
well not in , not in government , but in the private sector .
Um -- who be responsible , and um -- put they in a position to lead .
B Well , yeah , I think uh -- apparently -- the President like people that be the same philo - -- political philosophy as he , and I be not sure I mean I think he just need some other voice in there , but a that be right .
b I do not know if it will happen .
it be a that be a good point .
well , I b or not .
he he need some liberal in there and he need some -- Ralph Nader people , and some Green Party people , and some , just some .

I have to voice my opinion .
well , no , I mean you could go or , well Greg Uh , I -- okay , go ahead .
hey shoot , you get more sense than I do .
Christina okay , I -- have be follow the trial , I do not know why , ever since this whole thing happen .
I be a stay at home mom , so I get to watch the ~ tv more often , and I -- you know have be fo - -- watch all these forensic pathologist , Dr. Henry Lee .
you know , and and what I see be that there be no physical evidence that he do it .
and yeah , it sound like he do do it because he dye he hair , be try to get away , and the anchor and a boat .
but there be -- -- I for some reason , deep down in my heart , do not believe he do it .
and you know and I think the media make he guilty , and I think -- it be like you know , I mean you see what happen outside the courtroom , I do not know if you do or not , see how they be cheer on .
I do not think he be guilty and , I hope he do not get the death penalty .
and -- I do not know .
I I just do not think he be guilty .
I think he be wrong , what he do , everything , he cheat on he wife , that be so wrong , but -- that do not make he a murderer , he be just a cheater , he be just a -- you know , like one hundred ten percent you know eighteen karat -- asshole , like i - Mar - Mark Geragos call he .
Greg yeah .

Greg and so uh he figure , well -- these will , these thing would get rid of she I guess .
I do not , I do not know why like he uh , the wife 's or the mother say divorce be a option I think .
Christina yeah .
I know , that be very powerful .
not , you know , not murder and , oh , I mean , I do not know .
Greg but -- you know , I I can see , the guy be not think right .
he be screw up , you know , a despicable human being and he , just -- you know , the easy way out .
this will work , I guarantee I be too damn smart .
Christina but you know what , it be like I think they do not want to find he guilty because remember when ~ oj be not find guilty ?
I mean , oh my God , the , you know , but it be like , ~ LA would have like , turn ~ LA upside down , like all the , you know Greg yeah .
Christina I - it just , I do not know what would happen if he be find guilty , but now I think they say that they want to prove that -- you know , okay , we be not go to let this guy walk , like , do not let this guy walk either , big high profile case .
Greg Well , yeah you have to look , see , I think the locale , that both of they take place , and one take place in ~ LA , which be terribly open - mind and , uh , the other one take place in uh , Mida - well , uh -lrb- -lrb- redoak -rrb- -rrb- City .
Christina Mhm .

the truth be I do not really , uh , I do not really know much about that topic .
I do not really follow the trial very closely at all Hillary we do not have , uh , cable so we purposely do not watch the trial , but I read about it on the internet .
Kelly so Hillary and basically Kelly oh , really ?
Hillary he -- kill he wife when she be -- eight month pregnant and -- and dump she in , uh -- the ocean , basically .
Kelly so why be it so special ?
why do that , uh -- particular case make -- the the national news ?
Hillary I think it be because it be in such , it be like a , um Kelly like Hillary it be -- in such a quiet , upscale community where it happen and -- um just I think the fact of she be eight month pregnant , um , draw a lot of attention and Kelly yeah .
Hillary of course people be worry about she for a long time and then they find she and blah blah blah .
it be -- gossip , basically .
Kelly -lrb- -lrb- yeah , right . -rrb- -rrb-
oh , but the mistress have nothing to do with the murder ?
Hillary I think -- yeah , cause he find out , they find out he have a mistress , and then it be like , oh -- yeah .
be -- I do not think , I do not think so , but who know ?
I do not know .
Kelly Right .
Hillary very sad cause she have a child herself and so she drug she son through a lot of -- uh , drama that he do not need to be part of .
Kelly wait , what happen ?
Hillary I do not know .
she have a son too , so he he also get put -- um -- you know , in the spotlight a bit , from what I understand .
I do not , I do not have tv though , so I do not really know .
Kelly oh , the son of the , right right .
Hillary of -- of he girlfriend , yeah .

Hillary I do not know .
I hear though , that he be go to be -- the first person to be -lrb- -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- um -- uh -- kill for a crime in California in like , thirty five year or something .
oh .
Kelly oh , really ?
Hillary I do not know if they have , I do not know if they have -- um -- give he the death penalty yet .
but I think he would be the first in , in a really long time to actually -- be kill .
Kelly yeah , that be amazing .
Hillary I do not Kelly Um -- why , uh , now why do they decide that this be to be this big -lrb- -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- out of this with the most heinous crime in all of California ?
Hillary well , you know Kelly I mean I guess that be not how they decide who die , but it be because of the Hillary you know , and Kelly the , uh , cou - , like the -- the court that they go to , like the area do not Hillary well , I do not know why they decide on this , I think it be because it be so public of a case .
but they have a lot of Kelly yeah .
Hillary they have many many worse crime go on in California , parent kill they child and everything , that you would think -- would would , um -- you know , be Kelly Hearing more .
Hillary be more Kelly Stringent penalty , Hillary yeah , but they do not , they ignore those because this one get on television , I guess .
Kelly keep like -- uh , the jury from watch ~ tv and the media and stuff .
but I guess now -lrb- -lrb- it be , uh -rrb- -rrb- -- pretty much impossible -- to do .
Hillary I i do not know .
I never really get the whole -- watch it on ~ tv and and get into the whole -- mystery of it because , in the end , the woman 's dead and so be she child and -- and -- there be -- really no way of change that I guess .
Kelly yeah , uh , I think it be kind of strange how it be so publicize .
like I be just , seriously , like I do not , like I try not to watch , like -- too much , like Hillary you can not help it sometimes .
Kelly yeah I know .
but it just amaze I that , uh , I think it be ridiculous how publicize -- how much publicity it get because -- I mean there be like human rights violation go on all around the world .
I mean there be like , genocide in Sudan right now but like , nobody talk about that .
that be like -lrb- -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- Hillary oh yeah and what be go on in , I know and people -- flock , flock to the store to buy all they -- all they foreign make goods and it be like what be you -- do ?
obviously they do not really care about what be go on .
they just like to hear the detail .

I do not know .
Kelly Um -lrb- -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- it be almost like , uh -- -lrb- -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- diversion but it just seem like they just make it into like , like a soap opera for people to watch , you know ?

Mohammed ah , this be Mohammed , call from New York .
Jean Mohammed , call from New York .
glad to meet you .
well , the topic be interesting , but they have be have this one for three day .
I do not know why they be so obsess with it .
Mohammed seem like it be a weekend , or they want to get as much as they can feedback from people .
Jean I guess so , yes .
Mohammed and so what do you think be - Jean I I do not actually -- watch the trial very much , uh th - in fact , I do not watch the trial at all .
Mohammed Mhm .
Jean I read about it in the newspaper and thing like that .
um , I do think from all the , uh , thing that I have hear that he -- have to be guilty with all the evidence that they have , but um , I do not really know why , uh , if everybody be so , sort of , obsess about it when we have get so much other -- thing go on in the world that , uh , seem to I much more important , but um .
perhaps it be because he seem , uh , a very human kind of person and , and you cou - you could not really understand why he would want to do something about that .
I - I think he motive must have be to be with he new girlfriend , but uh - -- kill he own first child that way be extraordinary .
what do you think ?
Mohamed ?
Mohammed yeah .
Jean and what do you - what do you think about it ?
Mohammed be very frankly , I be not , uh , follow the case at all even uh uh television , or uh read , but from what I can observe , that it seem , eh , it have be talk -- -- take too long time .
like one year almost , now .
it be - Jean when you what ?
Mohammed it be -- take so much time .
long time .
Jean Yes .
Mohammed the case be almost one year .
like last , uh , Christmas if I be not , uh , recall my memory .
so for one year , it be really a good time .
hu - so I be ask myself why it take such a long Jean Hm .
Mohammed it may be because -- it be quite important , or so there be so many everything 's , I mean , it be , it be a really different case .
but , the quo - the nice quotient be about the media .
but the media have bias in this , Jean Yes .
Mohammed or not ?
I believe that media be a very good , uh , I mean , uh , way to give we all the opportunity to understand and see .
I mean without the media , you and I , how we will be know ?
Jean No , exactly .
do you think they be bias in in -- favor of he , or in favor Mohammed I - -- no , I do not think so .
Jean No , I do not think so either from what I hear .
Mohammed maybe -- sometimes in - in - in - in other issue they - they may be bias , but in this issue they be just -- cover what be happen , Jean Yes .
Mohammed and , uh , they give we the picture .
it be a camera -- to give you the view .
I do not think they be bias in this case here .
Jean Yes .
no .
Mohammed and , uh , what do you think will happen next ?
Jean Well , uh they be come up to the sentencing , and I hear yesterday or read in the newspaper or something that he brother -- I guess it be on the television .
in the news , he brother be appealing -- for they to to sentence he to -- to prison for life rather than the death penalty , because -- he say he be a very good listener and he care about people , and and he might be able to help a lot of people in prison .
I do not know whether that be true or not .
I know that he have do a lot of volunteer thing before , and that be the one thing that make I wonder there be any possible chance that it could have be somebody else who do it .
I think give such as I have hear , even though like you , I do not follow the case day by day or anything like that , I do not quite see how he could not be guilty if they have get so much that appear to point to he .
and what would be the motive for anybody try to -- to get he if it be not Mohammed yeah .

Gandhi Hi , good evening .
Marco Hi .
wha - I do not catch you name .
what be you name ?
Gandhi Gandhi from New York .
you ?
Marco Gindhi ?
Gandhi New York .
yeah .
Marco from New York .
Gandhi yeah .
Marco Uh , Marco from Illinois .
Gandhi okay , Mark .
uh , I think it be fresh topic for tonight .
Marco yeah , yeah .
good topic .
it be a good topic .
Gandhi so what do you think ?
Marco Well , um , I would - I would have to start - -- I would have to start , generally , in state - -- state what I think be the problem and -- - with the Middle East and what - for I , one of the major problem be the fact that -- the -- United States government give so much aid to the state of Israel .
in which , the state of Israel buy -- many expensive military weapon , ah , which be use to -- oppress and -- to kill a lot of Palestinians .
so , for I , that be -- the - that be essentially the root of the problem .
and , um , Yasser Arafat be kind of in a difficult position , because you have these , um , incredibly -- oppressed and in some way imprison , uh , Palestinians , and if -- Arafat have not , um , try to stand up -- and help they and - and fight for they rights , then -- m - they would not have respect Arafat , but then again , you know , he could not be too friendly with the West , um , and , um , and so he do the best he could , I think .
it be a difficult -- leadership role .
Gandhi Mhm .
Marco yeah .
um , what do - well , how about you ?
Gandhi I think , yeah , more or less , I c - I agree with what you say .
it be almost , this be my view as well .
and the question be , what next ?
I mean , some idea -- from israeli side , they be say -- he be a problem , and if he go , everything will be quite easy .
Marco yeah .
Gandhi Fine .
now he be not in anymore .
Marco yeah .
Gandhi so , let we wait and see .
Hope .
if he be a problem himself , hope - uh , the come one -- will be in a good -- position to negotiate with the other side , Israel , and then -- peace can be achieve .
Marco yeah .
Gandhi Uh , we have to wait and see , but , uh , it seem it be not easy .
Marco but , I , eh , I get the feeling that - -- it be almost - -- the peace process - we can not put it on -- the ro - or the - -- the whole responsibility of the pre - -- peace process can not be the leader of -- a - -- a group that be - -- I do not know , in my view , have -- not ver - not very many resource to fight - -- to fight this -- battle that -- they try to fight against -- a government that have take away a lot of they land , that , you know , do not allow they to really move around in they own country .
so , unless that -- stop , the , um , the leader of the Palestinians -- really can not do too much -- to further the peace process , because -- there be -- a lot of bad thing happen to the people -- of that -- leader .
Gandhi that be correct , as well .
Marco yeah , so it be - -- it be kind of , it be - -- it seem like the , um , the media , at least in the United States , be -- put all of this -- focus and responsibility on the leader of the Palestinians , as if it be Gandhi Marco Arafat 's fault that any of - -- any of the violence be cause .
so , it seem like a unfair treatment -- of - -- of , you know , the leader of -- the palestinian people .
um , yeah .
Gandhi Yes .
that be absolutely correct .
yeah .
Marco yeah .
hm .
Gandhi actually , it - it be a good topic to be choose , I mean , uh , because it be one of the fresh topic .
Marco yeah .
Gandhi how long have you be with the study ?
Marco Uh , this be probably my tenth or eleventh conversation .
Gandhi Tenth , eleven .
almost the same like I .
so , the other -- day , which one be quite interesting to you ?
Marco Um , well , there be be a couple where -- they have - they talk about the Cabinet -- for -- Bush , and Bush have be , um , you know , select new Cabinet member and -- all of the new member be people that I be - I do not really know very well .
so , there be be some topic where I be - I do not have very much information .
other topic -- you know , usually about the election that - -- that , um , I do have -- a lot of thing , um , to say .
yeah .
be you - be you , um , be you from the United States , or do you come from , uh - Gandhi I come from the area , I be from Egypt .
Marco you be from Egypt .
Gandhi yeah , so I be - I be quite , uh , Marco so you - Gandhi - cern about , uh - -- uh , over there I mean .

Ben yeah .
yeah .
sue well , good for you .
Ben and we be talk about Arafat here .
sue yes , Arafat .
let 's talk about Arafat .
what do you think ?
Ben Huh .
what do I think ?
um , well , when -- around the time he be he be get the Nobel Peace Prize and stuff , I think he get that .
sue yes , he do .
Ben Um , there be a show here in New York at a big theater .
I think maybe it be at Lincoln Center in the Philharmonic Theater or the Metropolitan Opera House or the New York State Theater or something .
and Arafat come in and get a standing ovation , you know , a peace prize winner bah bah bah bah bah .
the mayor of New York , who be then Rudolph Giuliani , stand up and walk out , he be also in attendance , and he , uh , comment to the press afterwards be that , you know , he just do not want to honor a terrorist , and I -- one of the few thing that I be happy about with Giuliani when he be mayor .
sue Mhm .
Ben Uh , Giuliani get very popular later because of the - the sue nine eleven .
Ben World Trade Center thing but he - he be not so popular as a mayor .
sue yeah .
right , I know that .
Ben but , you know , I - I kind of agree with that Arafat thing , though .
I -- but I do think he accomplish something in that the palestinian people do have a legitimate grievance and he put it on the map , you know .
sue well , he - -- he do but I think he really fail miserably , in my opinion , when he , um , refuse to sign that treaty that be originally set up because it be a wonderful -- option and it really could have re - do some wonderful thing for he people and I think he really do they a disservice by not take care of it at that time .
Ben Uh-huh .
uh-huh .
yeah , what be the treaty ?
I be not familiar with it .
sue well , um , where they be go to , uh , give they , like , ninety-six percent of the Ga - of - of Gaza and he say that he want all hundred percent .
and so he refuse to sign it .
it be just a - a incredible faux pas on he part , from my opinion .
Ben oh .
yeah .
yeah , y - it be - it be -- you have to sometimes take a little bit less than you want , you know , uh , a - and ninety-six percent be a big percentage , you know .
sue yes .
and I think that could have really do some wonderful uh step for -- uh for the palestinian people uh as a whole .
and I feel -- very sad that , um , that that be not -- do .
it really should have be .
um , it be really quite unfortunate that - that he -- that he be not willing to , um , step forward -- to do - do what be really in the best interest of he people .
Ben sometimes - sometimes I th - I think it be hard when - when you be the - the first leader , or the George Washington of something , to see thing other than in black and white .
you know , or maybe he do not have the gift of - of nuance that would have help he to - -- to take that right step , uh , you know , the - -- the -- he people suffer so terribly and maybe , you know , it could have be better if he have sign that , huh .
sue I really think so .
I really , truly do and now it be a - a situation where , with he passing , um , I think there be a real , um , new opening , a new possibility for - -- some extremely positive step to come forward out of this -- I do think that the United States -- will probably be request to be involve in the negotiation process and I understand that , I I - uh , because , um , I think -- both side -- have a trust in the United States that make it - Ben and we have ha - we have a history , uh , Clinton and Carter w - work over there -- - try to get some peace go .
they they they work very personally .
they have those retreat and thing with the leader , sue right .
Ben arm-twisting session .
and stuff , and uh -- that be why we should be there but I be I be kind of scared of the people -- that represent the United States now , you know .
they be not quite the same caliber .
sue well , that be really true , um , but it - it be a -- I mean , we be have a - a -- step forward in a lot of way , um .
we - we , I think , do have some potential , um , to do some extremely positive , um , um , thing .

opposite side of the coast .
Rainia yeah .
well , that be a interesting question they be ask .
Paul yeah , it be , uh , the past couple of topic have be -- more controversial than -- the early topic -- and , uh , well , I be - I be very opinionate .
I be happy to talk about it .
Rainia yeah , go right ahead .
Paul Well , um , Yasser Arafat be -- be he a good leader ?
I I think -- that , uh , he -- he be -- pretty much -- -- or he be pretty much -- follow what he have always do , even as a young man , uh , back in Algeria -- when - when he lead the -- terrorist attack against the french to kick they out of -- Algeria .
and I - I think he be do the same thing there in Palestine .
I - I do not think , eh , I do not think he really know how to , uh , take on the role of - of peacemaker .
you know , I be - I be -- you know , I could be wrong .
that be just my opinion .
but i - it seem like that - that be always a problem for he .
hm .
Rainia yeah .
um , I be not sure myself uh how good a leader he be .
I I -- it be hard to get the truth w - when the -- when the there be so many uh slant uh -- information Paul yeah .
rainia especially on the main media .
Paul that be true .
rainia I do not -- like the way -- Israel have be -- go after the Palestinians Paul Right .
I - I agree .
I think Ariel Sharon be a lot like Yasser Arafat .
and I -- can not understand why the two of they -- do not see the similarity .
Rainia yeah .
um , and they be ask -- too , of -- about the , should the ~ US be involve -- in that whole thing ?
Paul yeah .
that - that be interesting , too , because -- cut Yasser Arafat out of the whole thing be - -- be really -- George Bush 's decision .
I think -- personally , he do not like he because he think he be a - -- a liar -- so he refuse to -- have anything to do with he .
and , uh , th - rainia uh , which - which Bush be you talk about ?
Paul George ~ W Bush .
Rainia oh , ok - yeah .
Paul -lrb- -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- Rainia Well - Paul Ev - everything kind of stop when - -- when he become president and all , uh , activity regard -- Israel , Palestine stop .
and Israel pretty much could do what they want .
a - and you be right , it do not seem fair at all .
Rainia yeah , there be -- th - well , the way I see it , eh , Bush , eh , have a right -- wing Christian , right-wing agenda .
he he be -- some -- how think that -- if Israel have -- -- I be not sure that all -- they prophecy be -- but there be something about -- if -- they can -- get rid of the Palestinians , that will somehow , um , they prophecy -- come true and th - and then -- somehow -- I do not -- I - we do not -- understand what on Earth they be Paul that sound -- rainia try to achieve with this but i - it seem like a - Paul that sound kind of scary .
Rainia a Christian agenda , yeah , that that -- that , uh , the end of the world , the end time -- if , um , Israel take over -- Palestine that be h - some -- have something to do with the end time .
it be really -- frightening the way they talk -- and , um , I do not think he be qualify to be involve in this at all .
it never be right to begin with n - and , you know , we - we be - we be only give certain information and Paul Mhm .
Rainia hard to really know the whole -- real story of what be go on over there .
but I do know Paul Right .
rainia that what the Israelis be do be wrong .
by go into they territory and build these wall or build settlement -- push the Palestinians out and -- Palestinians -- fight -- with rock and -- stick and -- Israelis have they machine gun and bulldozer and -- I just -- t - really unpalatable that the -- whole idea , the -- the way they be go about -- this thing and -- I do not really feel qualify -- to say how it should be , but -- I -- see it -- be wrong to -- hurt child and -- innocent people .

Roger okay , I be Roger from , um , Atlanta .
Barb Hi .
so , what do you think about -- Arafat ?
be he a h - Roger Uh , I think that , um , I bet he be not a really good leader .
I think that , um , that he situation -- -- well , see I get to the -- to - to the level of power that he be in -- back in the eighty -- and once he , um , you know , start get wealthy and start get known , that he agenda ch - uh , change Barb Mhm .
Roger but it be not actually for peace but be to try to find a way to -lrb- -lrb- send -rrb- -rrb- the Israelis out of Jerusalem in the area that they want .
I really do not think that -- they want to coexist .
I think that , um , he want -- you know , all he people -- all he people want to coexist with the -- Israelis .
I think that , um , he death -- mark a beginning of try to find somebody that -- really want peace .
I do not think that in that area of the , um , world that you could actually have peace .
if you know the Bible well you would know that there be always go to be a conflict there .
um , I think that , uh , the United States should open up -- they -- door to -- not help , but support any , um , process for peace in the area , though .
I do not think that we should get involve to a level , a point where we be send people over there and , um , try to -- help keep the peace or anything like that , um .
there be a lot of stuff that can be do -- by just verbal suppo - -- you know .
I think that now he be go , he family be still around , and Barb yeah .
Roger uh , million and million of dollar that he have be still around but they -- if they bring people in that be not involve with he cabinet , n - um , have different view than he , somebody that gener - genuinely can accept the fact that the Israel - -- be - Israelis be there and they be there to stay -- and , um , we go to have to find a way to coexist .
if they can find somebody like that , then I think that they should f - support he and , um , and back he up -- in try to help define -- peace in the area where peace be impossible .
what do you think about it ?
Barb I agree with you .
I do not know that much about it , I be not much into politics back in the eighty .
I be more , um , kind of a -- I be a kid on the run from abusive parent back then so that be not a , you know , one of my topic of interest at the time , it be now .
um , I -- my roommate , and I still do not know that much about -- I would love to know more about politics and I be try to learn more , uh , tell I , you know , he be such a terrible man but , eh , I do not listen to everything he say .
and I think it -- -- I mean , it would be nice to have peace over there , but I agree with you , I do not think it be ever go to happen .
I mean , not the way -- -- not the way they will -- -- not like it be here .
and I agree that we should not send people over there .
we have get enough stuff go on with Roger yeah .
Barb Iraq and I - and , um , the -- other -- -- the other guy .
Roger yeah .
Barb we get way too much go and too much expense , I mean , we we can not , the that be Roger yeah .
Barb that would be just put it over the edge right there .
but I think ought support , you know , a man that , Roger Mhm .
Barb like you say , be -- would like to coexist -- with everybody and somebody that be Roger yeah .
Barb peaceful -- and , I do not know , I would like to learn more about the Bible .
my parent never take I to church or anything .
but , um , Roger yeah .
Barb I would like to -- I know that , you know , there be be problem , a lot of conflict over there , and it seem like no matter what , Roger ah .
Barb just like Iraq ye - eh , we try to go in and get peace and - and how long have it be and , I mean , I think Saddam need to be remove but it be - -- there be just -- s - all these people that be go to follow he no matter what .
Roger yeah , and , um , I only know about Yasser Arafat because I , um , study international affair a little bit -- and I know -- a very little bit about he because , of course he be a , um , leader for a long time , longer than the age that I be -- old , so , but I - I - I - I have notice -- on throughout my study that -- what he represent to the public -- be -- what he represent to the international public -- be not what he be represent to he people -- and he be represent , um , peace with the Israelis and he be represent try to find -lrb- -lrb- the whites or -rrb- -rrb- divide the land so that it would be , um , stop , um , uh , war and terrorist in the area .
but I do not think that he have the same image to - to he people .
I think that it be a front -- for he to allow to to be accept in a international community , but I think -- that he ultimate plan and goal be to to run the Israelis out -- maybe closer to the Gaza strip , and to re-take Jerusalem -- and other city near Jerusalem , and to , uh , uplift he people in a way that -- they could say , you know , we conquer the Israelis .
it be a matter of , uh -- I mean , it be more than just land , it be a , um , conflict of - -- of , um , hatred , uh , and racism , I mean , eh , different type of people , um , they do not like each other , Barb yeah .

Mark I - -- my name be Mark .
Ali my name be Ali , uh , Mark how you d - Ali from Pennsylvania .
Mark how you do ?
Ali I be fine .
how be you ?
Mark Good , good .
not too bad .
Ali Uh , so let I ask you , do you think Arafat be , uh , a good leader or not ?
Mark Um , to hi - -- yeah , I - -- I think he do what he think -- be right for he people .
I - I - -- I would say he be a good leader -- for - -- for , uh , he people .
and as far as we involvement there , should be as little as possible .
just let they do -- what they , you know , what they be go to do -- and we should stay out of it -lrb- -lrb- just -rrb- -rrb- as -- much as we can .
uh , this country seem to get involve too much in other people 's politics .
should just let they do whatever they be go to do , Ali Uh , Mark you know .
Ali mm , by the way I be from Arab origin , so I also have , uh , uh , the same opinion -- like you .
I believe he -- -- in my opinion he - he be a good leader -- and , um , I believe what , eh , have to be do -- right now be to -lrb- -lrb- apply -rrb- -rrb- -- the United Nations ' , uh , decision about the conflict between Arab and Israel because there be -- -- there be a lot of , uh , decision have be make -- have be make -- and this , uh - for example , one of they be , uh , decision number two forty-two -- and this be about -- the ha - establish two - two country , one for Israel and another one for Palestine .
Mark Right .
Ali so , if we -- -- eh , if United States , Bush , Israel -lrb- -lrb- tell -rrb- -rrb- th - the solution or to , uh , to make the decision , eh , I think this will solve -- the problem .
the -- unfortunately what happen right now - -- the -- for example , which be -- little bit toward it be - it be interest .
for example , when there be , uh , like , a -- decision against Iraq , the United States -- go directly -- to Iraq to -- -- for , eh , uh , a invasion -- and -- for -- whatever reason - -- she even be out , uh , put any attention to the United Nations , uh , like , uh , approval .
she do wha - what she want .
but , eh , eh , for israeli , palestinian conflict there be a lot of decision that have to be -- apply but until now -- she do not put any pressure , eh , toward -lrb- -lrb- this and -rrb- -rrb- and I believe this policy have be , uh , this kind of policy , eh , um , eh , become more and more during -- eh , during , uh , eh , Bush -- -- President Bush time .
for example , before , eh , during Clinton , I believe at that time -- Clinton be try hard -- to solve this problem and I believe at that time , if you remember , um , Yasser Arafat -- and , uh , the prime minister of Israel , he name be Barak , they meet together in the White House -- and -- they almost come to a agreement -- to solve this problem -- and during Clinton , eh , period -- they have , uh , this -lrb- -lrb- Oslo -rrb- -rrb- a - eh , agreement .
most of the big problem between the two party , they negotiate everything almost and there be -- there be , like , final step that have to be solve .
but , uh , I think if there be , like , the , um , the same policy have to be follow after Clinton .
I think -- everything would - -- - finish then - -- the -- I think United States -- go to another direction and , eh , they forget about this problem right now .
Mark yeah , I g - eh , see , I do not , Ali Mark um , when - when policy be set by one -- -- by one president -- towards - towards one thing , it be usually -- follow through , if there be something to follow through , by the -- next president in turn .
he be more or less obligate -- to continue , uh , the process that be already start -- but -- I think -- Bush 's -- agenda -- be not -- towards that right now .
that be not he priority , I do not think .
Ali yeah , I think so , yes .
Mark and , eh , uh , although , you know , it be be a long time -- that -- i - they have both -- b - both Israel and Palestine , they both need a -- they both need they own country -- and - Ali that be , uh , true because , uh , Mark a - -- eh , y - Ali in the United Nations they have establish -- eh , they make this decision already .
Mark r - right , right .

Um , Irvin oh really ?
Winnette Well um , I have be follow it pretty closely .
um , I guess because of -- you know it be a mother and -- be pregnant for a baby .
Irvin oh , uh-huh .
Winnette Um , kind of hit more to -- I you know to home .
um , so you -- how much of it have you follow ?
do , do you -- follow any of it at all when it be on in the news or in the papers or anything ?
Irvin hardly any of it at all , because -- um -- for one thing -- I do not have a ~ tv or a radio and I do not get a daily newspaper .
we get Winnette oh wow .
Irvin we get a weekly newspaper .
Winnette okay .
Um , well I will I do not get any newspaper at the house , but -- I listen to the radio every morning on my way to work and Irvin oh yeah ?
Winnette and uh -- when it first happen it be -- pretty publicize on every radio station um -- it come across -- on the news and we keep we ~ tv on at my work , because we have a customer wait area , so irvin oh , uh-huh .
Winnette um actually one of we employee have wa - watch -lrb- -lrb- happen -rrb- -rrb- -- so from that point on we kind of -- talk a lot about it at work and Irvin how long ago be it ?
Winnette different thing .
um , it be a year -- almost a year ago .
over a year ago ?
because it be just before Christmas -- that it happen .
Irvin over a year ago .
Winnette yeah .
um , I be think -- I do not know , November , December , I be not sure exactly .
but I know it be just before Christmas -- when they have uh -- it have happen , because she be miss during Christmas and then they have find she body .
and they -- they find the baby as well .
Irvin terrible .
Winnette Um , so when they find the baby , the baby of course have be -- they do not know if the baby be bear , through delivery , or -- if maybe from um -- the corpse I guess Irvin so the baby be separate .
Winnette maybe extract it .
um , actually she be pregnant for the baby .
Irvin but the baby be separate from the body when he find it ?
Winnette Yes .
Yep .
um , I do not know if ma - I you know I do not know the whole story for sure , but -- um -- he have -- you know , obviously -- deny that he be involve anything to do with it .
then they find out that he be have a affair on she .
and -- then of course when they be investigate he -- he try run .
dye he hair and -- grow out a mustache and -- they catch he try to run with -- quite a bit of cash .
Irvin wow .
Winnette so I mean , Irvin -lrb- -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- Winnette he be -- in all honesty be guilty all along the way but Irvin Uh-huh .
Winnette of course you know they have get to give he that reasonable doubt .
Irvin Uh-huh .
so be he be he still um -- in prison now ?
Winnette yeah .
and they be make the determination if -- in fact he will get the death penalty , or life in prison .
so that be what be be up in the air right now .
Irvin what state be this in ?
Winnette California .
Irvin it be in California .
Winnette and -- um -- I know I have , it be suppose to have be deliberate on -- the twenty-second of November , but they have a issue happen with -- one of the juror -- so it be postpone everything .
but , actually they be try to pass a law , and I do not know if it ever do take into effect , that if in fact a mother be kill , and pregnant , um -- for there to be a double murder charge .
Irvin oh , uh-huh .
Winnette and -- they be in fact try to enforce the death penalty on that charge if they be -- find guilty on both charge .
Irvin Uh-huh .
Winnette and -- so it be kind of up in the air now -- because he -- I believe he get first degree murder and -- um and then get manslaughter on the baby .
so he do not get both first degree murder .
Irvin what be the difference ?
Winnette where -- um , I guess because he do not murder the baby directly .
Irvin oh .
Winnette I be think maybe be the difference .
and because of the the charge on the baby , they could not automatically give he the death penalty , but -- obviously there be enough -- um , complaint or whatever Irvin what be he excuse for do something horrible like that ?
Winnette and -- well he still deny everything .
he have never admit Irvin -lrb- -lrb- still do -rrb- -rrb- Winnette to do it .
um -- but the only thing they can figure be that maybe -- he want back into the bachelor life , and do not want to be a father , do not want to be tie down with a wife and child Irvin so he do not have any other child ?
Winnette that be -- no , that be go to be they first .
and actually I do not even think they be marry that long , maybe a year or two .

I know they be also -- I have be read some article lately about they be -- think about , uh , uh , why should only a native bear person be allow to , uh , be President .
Lynn oh , I know .
that be kind of interesting to -- think that , I mean , I think it will be a long time before -- they would change that .
Dave yeah , but , uh , just in the last uh , well , actually just in the last month or so I -- be really the only time I have ever hear anybody even even talk about it .
and , uh , well , I I -- I do read a a column today by , uh , a hispanic fellow and , uh , he be not native bear , he be from Cuba , and , uh , he state that , uh , we he be in the fifth grade and and , uh , uh , he be take -- no , I guess he be in middle school and he be take a civic class and and it be point out to he that , you know , he could never become President .
and he state at that time , you know , he say , well , okay I can not be President I will never , you know , get involve in politics .
so , you know , he kind of thought that be unfair .
Lynn Well , you know , in one sense it be but then , I mean -- well , my grandparent come over , Ellis Island and everything , but when I think about , you know , a foreign person or maybe bear in another country and come here it doe - it do not seem right in one sense for -- for they to be able to be President of this country .
Dave Right .
Lynn but -- it kind of fall like -- I mean I have be on the internet lately and I have run across these really weird website -- and I be not a fanatic or anything but they be all about the -- the new world , one world government and thing like that , you know , and to I it be just another point in that direction .

I watch a show on channel nine about Bush and he be religious , spiritual , of course , but also religious when he father be not , and -- I do not know .
you know , you hea - I I think it be all a bunch of lie , and -- I I do not I be not crazy about Bush .
there be some thing about he , you know , the fact that he do act spiritual and thing like that , I like that , I think that be what get he in office but , Dave Uh-huh .
Lynn um Dave Well what do you think of he as a man ?
do you think he be , uh , a good man or do you think he be get -- any good quality , or Lynn Uh , I -- you know , I want to say that he probably be but then I look at the thing like where he want -- the thing he be do .

Obo yeah , yeah , it be , yeah , you be absolutely , yeah , and I be sorry , I mean , if you want to add anything I be sorry .

Obo and , ah -- it be , it be just that -- like , I I just , I think that the last fifty year , the government have be mes - mess up by both these party , honestly .
even maybe before that .
so , I , I usually do third party -- um , and the way it be work this year be that the Democrats really push to get Ralph Nader off the ballot Ted yeah .
yeah they do .
Obo in every state , and um -- I mean , the Republicans sort of try to play like they be help he out , but they know they they do not really have to because they know the Democrats be already do more damage to keep he off the ballot and they be successful , and for a progressive party that be very brutal .
Ted Mhm , it be .
Obo and I be not really impress by either of the two vice presidential candidate , I know Dick Cheney seem to be run the show Ted you know ?
Obo and , ah -- I mean , and , and a lot of it have to do -- and then , I just do not know much , John Edwards seem nice , but he just , you know , he be just , he just get elect to the Senate , and , I be not really familiar too much with hi - I mean , I think it be great that he get into the vice presidential role , but -- again , it be the whole party that I be really not really I do not like they policy .

Ted the , the situation , though , now that I be out and , in the civilian sector , um , I find that the economics as far as home -- be what I be most concern with .
and because of the economic situation , I do not think that be be address .
yes , I feel very , very bad in regard to the , ah , nine-eleven tragedy and terrorism and this kind of stuff Obo Mhm .
Ted um , but I think so much attention be be pay to that -- that -- as you mention , over the past fifty year , the two party that run the country -- um , have definitely take a , um -- streamlined approach to whatever they agenda may be and not the will of the people .
Obo you say it very well .
I totally , you coul - I could not have say it better .
Ted now it be uh -- and as time go on , you know , like , ah , what be we , you know , head for , what be we face with ?
Obo I I Ted I mean , if we do not start look inward and start take care of thing at home -- uh , right now , yeah , we be the biggest power in the world .

Marco Good , good .
so , uh the election , um -- the , um -- let 's see , overall I feel -- ju - just give you a brief -- summary , I feel -- that -- John Kerry and Edwards be be pretty strong candidate and -- uh -- mm , I do not know , I guess just in term of policy I do not -- I do not , uh , find -- that as compelling as just -- the personality of -- the different candidate .
Derek yeah .
Marco feel like I could trust Kerry -- uh , little bit more even though he be much more of a politician than Bush .
Derek Mhm .

Marco Uh , he be -- kind of a smooth talker and Derek Mhm .
Marco Um -- uh -- seem like a politician , they way he present Derek Mhm .
Marco he you know he he um argument .
but -- uh -- strangely I feel like that what , that be -- one of -- one of he good quality because I do not feel Bush be politician enough .
that um -- one of the -- issue that I be concern about be just -- the representation of the United States and -- on the international stage Derek Sure .
Marco and I just -- uh -- I uh -- I do not know , uh , Bush be -- the way he present um -- the ~ US position -- uh -- seem a little -- abrasive to I .
Derek Mhm .
Marco and I -- feel like , hm -- if we be try to , um -- make -- um -- the United States safer and more stable -- conflict in the world more stable then we probably need somebody -- who be a little bit more -- of a politician in the sense that -- the , they care about diplomacy and -- uh , even though we may not -- give in to -- the will of the other nation present it in a nicer way .
Derek Mhm .

Derek eh , but that be just a add bonus for I in the fact that -- I too be obviously at this point in time concerned about the welfare of we security -- and I feel personally that if -- Kerry be in office we have kind of be , uh -- up a creek without a paddle because I think -- he be so lay back -- um , and not as aggressive as Bush that at this point in the game , where we be at -- we be in this thing full full -- steam ahead Marco Uh huh .
Derek and for a transition to occur at this point -- to someone who be lay back -- and not as aggressive as he I think would actually endanger the ~ US even more .
Marco yeah .
Derek I think that the international , uh uh , leader would look at Kerry and know , they be very smart , I mean they be -- they be on top of these thing , they know , you know , it would , it just would have open a gateway .
Marco Uh huh .
Derek I feel Marco yeah .
Derek that , uh , it may have actually put we in more danger .
at least Bush have -- pull out the gun , you know , stick to they , and um -- you know , that be where I be come from on that .
Marco yeah .
Derek and then when I Marco -lrb- -lrb- do you think -rrb- -rrb- Derek I listen to a lot of talk radio and when I hear the stuff about Kerry back in the -- the the , apparently the scandal he be pull as far as the uh , medal when he serve time .
Marco Uh huh .
Derek you know , uh -- I listen to a lot of talk radio and speak with , you know , hear from a lot of , uh -- veteran -- and they say it be physically , uh , impossible for he to achieve what he say he do .
Marco Uh huh .
Uh huh .
Derek and all the meeting he be miss , and just , you know , I think it be more of a status quo for he .
Marco yeah .
Derek I think he be more , he get so much money that I think he be just concern with attain this position and a title .
Marco yeah .
Derek you know -lrb- -lrb- flag -rrb- -rrb- for he , so Marco do you think , um -- the -- when the Republicans be campaigning -- they be say that well , another attack on the U.S. be -- imminent , that it probably -- probably go to happen -- and -- um -- and -- they even go so far to say that if -- it be really difficult to prevent something like this and of course they be do the best they can and -- I think Kerry would do the best he could .
but do you think , um -- that -- and this be not quite a political issue , but do you think that -- there be go to be another attack on the ~ US ?
uh like in the next five year ?
something big like -- the world -lrb- -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- Derek I , I do not know what you belief be , as far as , uh -- biblically or spiritually or whatever , but -- I believe it be inevitable .
I mean , we be go down , you know ?
and , yeah , and this be , all these thing have be write about actually .
Marco really ?
Derek Um -- The tw - the uh -- what be it , the tower , uh -- that be actually uh there be reference to that in the bible .
Marco yeah , I have hear , I have hear about that .

Ed Uh , well , let 's see , my past view be , uh -- illness-wise , ah -- I do not think -- it help he , be in the compound .
James Right .
right .
Ed but , you be , you know , you be never go to know if there be any , ah , clandestine-type operation that -- aid he , ah -- ah , illness .
James Mhm .
Ed I think that they , ah , -lrb- -lrb- -rrb- -rrb- , I do not think you be ever go to find out if there be any direct James Right .
Ed tamper James Right .
Ed but I do not , you know , from just the generic point , or general point of view , it do not help he illness once he get -- sick -- be in the compound , close in like that with the Arabs .
James Right .
right .
Ed and that James I do not -- I do not know if I think there be something -- you know , malicious do , because , you know , look back -- he be be have this shake thing go on Ed yeah .
James for quite some time .
and I agree that the surroundings could not have help .
Ed Right .
James yeah , it , it could have only exacerbated , uh , he situation .
because for -- for a good little while now I have notice , you know , that he lip would tremble , and Ed yeah .
James and , you know , it be like , um , uh , almost like he have , uh , what be that , Parkinson 's ?
Ed yeah .
James Uh , something like that , but , uh , I do not know what the exact condition be -- in that compound , but they could not have be could not have be , ah , conducive to someone of he age -- and of he health -- and as far as , as , ah , the United States send a senior ~ US official , I think they should have send someone -- I do not know how senior that person have to be .
but , uh , it could have be a gesture Ed Well they do -- they do send somebody , I think .
do not they go with a senior official , I have James to Ed do not think they be go to ask this question , but I James oh y - yeah , you be right , they do send someone .
Ed but it be not -- like , ah , be not Bush , I definitely would not send he , I do not think you want to have he in that part of the world right now .
James Right .
no .
no .
no , I do not think Ed regardless of what you think about he , he be , ah James yeah , I do not think he should have go -- as a matter of fact , I do not think any senior official should have go , I do not think -- Secretary of State Colin Powell should have go .
uh , whoever they send be , be good enough .
Ed yeah .
James yeah , be good enough , just to show -- the palestinian people -- that , uh you know , America do care somewhat -- that you have lose you leader .
but , uh , no , it would have be -- it would have be a wro - as a matter of fact , I think send Bush would have make it worse .
you know .
uh , because he be not like that much by the palestinian people .
so I , I do not think send he would have be -- would have be the right thing to do .
Ed No , I agree with that .
James yeah , I do not think it would have add anything to -- to the situation .
and possibly could have make it worse .
Ed yeah .
James yeah .
Ed as to -- he burial James Mhm .
Ed ah , not anymore , these be all , uh like these be all political response James Huh .
right .
Ed you know , there be no right answer , consider that that be not James Mhm .
Ed you know , they be still argue over -- that land , and be it , ah James yeah .
Ed who own it and respect , so I mean it be James Mhm .
I would say my overall opinion be that -- this conflict be way past that time .
Ed yeah , well , James you know , it be be go on for all these many -- what , Ed hundred .
James hundred of year -- and a lot of people have lose they life , and and a lot of kid have grow up and all they have ever know -- on both side israeli and palestinian , all they have ever know be war .
and it be just tiresome .
I mean , that be , that be my , my view , this thing have go so long -- like you say , about a piece of land .
and it be just , you know , they , they , they get to learn at some point -- that they be go to have to be able to get along .
or this be just go to keep go around , and around , and around , and , you know , the the -- the Palestinians will , will , will -- will -- will do something , then Israel will respond , and then back and forth -- and it be just like a never end circle .
Ed oh yeah .
James it be like a never end circle of violence and death and destruction .
and , like I say , I be personally just tire of it .
I think the world be just tire of it .
Ed oh yeah .
James you know .
and they need to try and , try and , I , I mean , I do not have the answer .
you know , I do not have all the answer .
I just know that it be just -- just a ongoing situation that be - there seem to be -- no end in sight .
Ed I agree .

I be in Delaware .
Mike Hi , this be Mike .
I be in California .
Paul Nice to meet you , Mike .
Mike yeah , nice to meet you .
Paul Uh , well , pretty complicate -- topic .
Mike yeah , interesting issue .
I do not know .
what do you think ?
you think it be poison ?
Paul Well -- -lrb- -lrb- smoosh -rrb- -rrb- no , I I hear that just a couple of day ago and -- I I kind of doubt it or at least I hope not .
I guess that be what it be .
Mike yeah , I do not think he be poison .
I think he be just fr - frail and I think he would be uh , he would be look frail and he be shaky .
Paul yeah .
Mike you know , he would be look h - like he be shake and , uh , seem frail .
for some time when I would see he in public , uh , Paul yeah , that be true .
Mike presentation -- so forth .
Paul Right .
Mike and I think it whatever it be , it get he , just catch up with he and and he reach the you know , the end of he time .
Paul yeah .
Mike so , that be about it on that , I guess .
Paul yeah .
well , I I guess now that that he be he be die -- it will be , uh , or it it should be a change for the ~ PLO Mike Well , yeah , it will be change .
I I do not know if it will move forward any better -- but , uh , this , uh , I have hear we administration think it will .
I think he be a block to the peace -- but I think it be not only he do , it be also the -- you know , the , uh , more , uh , drastic element of the ~ PLO that , uh , that , uh , would not allow he to pursue peace Paul Right .
Mike at any cost .
Paul Well , I be -- I be -- I do not know , uh .
he he seem like a guy who be much more comfortable -- be under siege than in negotiate peace settlement .
Mike Uh-huh .
Paul Um , I Mike yeah .
Paul maybe that Mike Well , you know , he be kind of damned if he do and damned if he do not .
Paul yeah .
well Mike you know , if he if he make peace he have faction of he own people that would have kill he -- and if he do not make peace , eh , then he be consider , you know , the the warmongering , uh , man who will not make peace , you know .
so , he , uh , he could not really win .
I do not think he could make peace .
I do not know if anyone else can , either .
Paul yeah , I guess that be the big question , if someone moderate take over and they reach a settlement , do that mean the ~ PLO will split ?
I mean that -- that could be just -- dangerous .
Mike yeah .
Paul I guess , uh , make peace with half of the Palestinians be better than nothing .
Mike one of the other question it ask we be , do we think we president and we , uh , you know , official should have attend he funeral .
Paul -lrb- -lrb- oh , I b - -rrb- -rrb- Mike what do you think about that ?
Paul yeah .
well , I I do not remember who they send , but they do send over some very -- low level state department person Mike oh , I see .
Paul and , uh , Mike I do not know that .
Paul I I -- I be kind of embarrassed about that .
Mike that we do or d - that we do not send we official .
Paul I mean -- we -- we do , but i - it be some -- it be a nobody , basically .
Mike so you be embarrassed because you think they should have send someone higher up ?
Paul yeah .
Mike oh , I see .
Paul I I -- I mean , for for the funeral ceremony in , uh , Egypt .
-lrb- -lrb- I mean -rrb- -rrb- Mike yeah , I think so , too .
I think they should have send someone higher up .
Paul and , uh , I I can understand that they would not want to send anybody Mike -lrb- -lrb- that he -rrb- -rrb- -- do not forget this be the this be the representative of a whole people , you know what I mean ?
Paul yeah .
Mike The past he be they main representative and , uh , just out of respect for the people we should have send someone I think .
Paul Hm .
bad bad or good .
yeah , I think it would have be a much more positive message .
Mike yeah .
Paul -lrb- -lrb- we realize that -rrb- -rrb- Mike I think it would have , uh , you know , be a -- a step toward , um , you know , gain the , uh , I do not know , the respect and and the , um , Paul Right .
yeah , I think that Mike uh , th - of the people that we be go to have to be work with to try to bring about a peace , you know .
Paul that -lrb- -lrb- yeah , -rrb- -rrb- it -- yeah .
Mike and , uh , it would have -- go a - a little farther to encourage they to , you know , be willing to sit down at the table with we , at least , you know .
Paul that be true .
Mike and , I mean not that it would have even be notice -- in that regard have he -- have have we president or someone higher go , but the fact that they do not , that be what be really go to be notice , you know what I mean ?
Paul yeah .
well , uh , you know , Colin Powell be a -- pretty moderate guy and would have be nice to see he there or maybe -- the , uh , Deputy -- secret of state .
Mike Uh-huh .
Paul I be not even sure who that be .
eh , somebody will -- or higher up .
Mike yeah , someone m - a little more , uh Paul some flunky bureaucrat .
Mike yeah .
yeah , it do not seem quite appropriate .
Paul but , uh , at at least for the ceremony in Egypt I think , uh , I can understand that no one would want to go into -- palestinian territory .
I mean , they it be total chaos there .
Mike Uh-huh .
sure .
yeah .

Pretty good .
Mike so - so what do you think ?
Marco Well , I be think - Mike how about you start .
Marco yeah , okay , um , -lrb- -lrb- lot of question -rrb- -rrb- -- and , um , I - I do not think it be poisoning , even though I have not read -- a lot of article about it .
I think - Mike he - he be old .
I mean - Marco y - he be old , yeah .
and - -- and that - i - I do not realize he be not allow to be bury in Jerusalem , which - Mike yeah , but a lot of that have to do with thing that he be do .
Marco yeah .
Mike he be - I mean , like , you know , let 's - i - -- for - for all he do in he later year , eh , Yasser Arafat be responsible for -- a good chunk of al - you know , a lot of -- israeli die -- i - you know .
he basically , eh , i - I be completely tear on the whole thing .
I mean , on one hand -- I think it be kind of wrong that -- that -- you know , the ~ UN just kind of go in and say , hey , you know , guess what ?
you know , we be - we be you know , this be Israel now , state of Israel .
and basically what they do be they carve up the region and - -- without any regard to , you know , tribal -- animosity really , be really what it boil down to , Marco Uh-huh .
uh-huh .
Mike um .
you know , then it th - it be there , he have to try to maintain the status quo -- but they breed -- people like Yasser Arafat , I mean , if it -- if it be not for the stupidity of the United Nations , people like Yasser Yara - Arafat w - probably would have never even get off the ground , you know .
Marco how how do the United Nations , uh , Arafat in power , or help ?
Mike Well , in other word eh , in other -- when -- after World War two when they when -- basically the state of Israel be form Marco Mhm .
Mike in f - uh , nineteen forty eight , I think it be .
Marco yeah .
Mike Um , you know , you - e - -- grant , you know , there be there be jewish people already live there , but -- all the jewish people start go there and they j - basically just - you know , they just take over .
and - and Marco yeah .
Mike in in a region where , uh , you know , y - you know , we live in America .
it be like coup - you know , f - we country 's a couple hundred year old , we get a couple of gripe go back to , you know , what , seventeen seventy six , Marco yeah .
Mike there it go , you know , thous - it be like the Hatfields and the McCoys .
they be fi - they do not even know why they be fight anymore .
they just they hate each other -- and they be always go to hate each other -- and it do not matter who start it , but -- i - you know , somebody eh , th - somebody be in always intent on win .
and it be and it be it be you know , a war of attrition .
nobody win .
it be either , you know , you may kill I , but I be go to kill all of you before - y - you know what I mean ?
it be just i - i - it be stupid .
the whole thing 's stupid .
and a guy like Yasser Arafat , Marco yeah .
yeah .
Mike he be a terrorist .
in in the sixty -- in the mid sixty a - and and a - you know , on into - -- you know , through the mid eighty -- the guy be a terrorist .
Marco so , let we let we not forget that when Israel be -- form -- and they be , um , the -- the Israelis for not feeling -- like they have a legitimate -- right -- some of the land or that -- land be not , um , rightfully theirs .
there be -- two very strong -- militant group that be israeli and they -- commit a lot of terrorist act , Mike oh , the yeah , the Zionists .
abso - absolutely .
Marco much -- yeah .
so , I mean , i - -- you know , uh , how we consider -- Arafat a terrorist , we also should consider that -- could have be , in some way , a reaction to some of the terrorism that be -- initially -- commit by the Israelis .
Mike absolutely .
I be not believe I , I be not I be not excuse -- anybody -- but for the purpose I I mean , the way I see it be you know , I guess for the purpose of the conversation th - -- that they want to hear , Marco yeah .
Mike y - you get to kind of have to put that as y - -- i - it be kind of like -- do if that be the case , do two wrong really make a right ?
you know what I mean ?
Marco but if Arafat have not be I do not know if he be -- directly -- be link to Hamas ' act , uh , but he be put in a -- pretty -- sticky situation have to negotiate -- the militant of -- Palestine -- the international leader -- and if it if Hara - Arafat have not -- somehow appease -- the Hamas group or the palestinian militant , then -- he would have be kick out , overthrow -- by - -- by the Palestinians .
Mike oh , forget about kick out or overthrow , he would have be kill .
that be - that be how it work over there .
Marco yeah .
yeah .
exactly .
well , it it be not really Arafat -- as a individual , I think it be just -- whatever leader -- be -- place in the position of - Mike he be he be basically -- I mean , I have read I have read article a - and - and - and -- story that basically have link he to the to the to the Munich -- massacre -- th - you know , the Munich Olympic massacre th - the be - the israeli team .
it - -- the the problem be -- what he do -- back way back when Marco Uh-huh .
Mike will -- f - forever tarnish anything that he do -- in he later year .
like like you say , bring the group together but the reason that he be able to bring they together be because he be once one of they .

what do you think of Israel 's policy surround Arafat 's illness and death ?
should President Bush or a senior US official have attend Arafat 's funeral ?
should Israel have let Arafat be bury in Jerusalem ?
James hello ?
Joe hello , my name be Joe .
James I be James from Detroit .
Joe Uh , from , uh , New Jersey , but I be live in Atlanta now , go to college .
James oh , okay .
Joe All right .
James -lrb- -lrb- I be sorry . -rrb- -rrb-
Joe so , uh , what do you think about Arafat ?
James Well -- I , uh , I do not think there be anything malicious , uh , in term of he death -- uh , just look at he these last , uh , couple of year uh , it seem like he have Alzheimer 's or something .
Joe yeah , he have be get older .
James yeah , because he be quiver at the mouth and and hand be shake .
and -- I would imagine that living in that compound could not have be that conducive to he health .
Joe yeah , he probably should have be in a hospital or a hospice or James Right .
Joe you know , if it be that bad .
James Right .
right , I be sure that they , I do not know about , bout -- the uh sanitary condition there , but -- I I just do not think it could have be , uh , conducive to he health .
and as far as , uh , Israel , uh , allow -- he to be bury -- uh , in Jerusalem Joe that be accept James huh ?
Joe that be acceptable to I .
I mean James Well , it , it be acceptable to I , but I do not think it be feasible .
Joe feasible James yeah , give the circumstance in that area right now .
I do not even know if they would have be able to pull it off , you know ?
Joe Well , uh , so he , in fact he be not James Pardon I ?
Joe so , um -- no , so he be not bury in Jerusalem .
James No .
no , they bury he -- uh , inside that compound .
Joe oh , I see .
James yeah , they bury he inside that compound .
but like you say , I do not , I do not -- I personally -- uh -- would not have see a problem with it , but -- I just do not think it be feasible .
I do not , I do not think that they would have be -- uh , secure enough to really do it .
I do not think either side would have really -- let it happen -- and -- and as far as a senior U.S. official go , I do not think that would have be necessary either .
um , I know President Bush should not have go -- and he be not go .
Joe Well , I kind of feel , I kind of feel another way .
I think a senior U.S. service in there , should have be there , because I mean -- he , Arafat 's be -- be the one come to all these peace talk , you know , with President Clinton and , you know , other James Mhm .
Joe other um -- litigation towards that .
James Mhm .
Joe you know , I think , I think we could have just show we face and say you know , yeah , we do recognize this man .
James Mhm .
well it , they send someone .
I do not know who it be -- -lrb- -lrb- it be not -rrb- -rrb- Joe it probably , it be not anybody important .
it be just like a James yeah it be a under secretary , there be no doubt about it .
there be no senior Joe James there be no senior U.S. official there .
there be there be no question about that .
Joe yeah .
James but , uh -- you know , uh , Bush 's policy -- towards , uh , Yasser Arafat have be hand off Joe yeah .
James from from the begin cause I do not , I do not think he ever even meet with he .
do he ?
Joe I do not think so .
I do not think so .
James yeah , I I Joe Bush be kind of like , stay away from the whole Israel -- palestinian James Mhm .
now on he part I think that be a mistake .
Joe yeah .
James yeah , you know you get to engage people in some type of dialogue Joe and James if you Joe to I , the talk , the peace talk should have continue -- after Clinton 's administration leave .
James True .
Joe Cause at the cause at the end Clinton be do all this peace talk with Arafat and , um James True .
Mhm .
Joe -lrb- -lrb- forget -rrb- -rrb- the um , prime minister in Israel , but he be talk to he .
James Uh , Sharon .
Joe Sharon , yeah .
James yeah .
Mhm .
Joe they be do all these talk in Camp David and and it should have just continue when br - Bush come into office .
James you be absolutely right .
I agree .
like I say , I think that be one of Bush 's biggest mistake , Joe Mhm .
James not continue -- the talk .
because Clinton have come so very close Joe Yes .
James to to maybe get some type of agreement Joe No .
James but , uh , Bush just take a hand off approach .
he just -- kind of take a hand off approach .
Joe and now the situation in , you know , Jerusalem and the West Bank be just -- escalate .
James absolutely .
and I think too -- Israel 's -- position toward Arafat -- in term of keep he sort of like -- uh -- surround in that compound -- I do not think that be a good idea .
Joe No .
James you know , because that , you can not pick a leader for a people .
whether you like they or not -- people get to choose who they want to follow , Joe exactly .
James and the Palestinians have make it clear -- that Arafat be they leader .
Joe exactly .
James so , I think that they , we should have find a way -- Israel should have find a way -- to -- keep some type of dialogue -- go along .
cause uh , I mean , you look at what be go on now .
Joe Mhm .
James I mean , they policy toward he do not get they anything .
and then you get suicide bombing on the one side , and then you get Israel -- you know , it be like one day , you will he - a bomb will go off , the next day Israel will do and air strike and -- you know , it be like go around in a circle .
Joe yeah .
James it be like go around in a circle .
Joe it be really a bad situation .
James it be .
it be , and it be , it be be so long -- go on , I mean , you be talk about something that be be go on historically for hundred of year .
Joe hundred of year and then , it just recently really come into spectrum , James Mhm .
Joe what , nineteen forty nine ?
James Mhm .
Mhm .
Joe when um -- the Israel state -- come into be , or whatever .

she be the oldest and I be the youngest , so she be get younger which -- keep the thing go , so I - -- you know , my view be -- -lrb- -lrb- stay -rrb- -rrb- with the family go visit the family .
that be all you get .
so -- keep it together through thick and thin and -- when it come to Thanksgiving we go up there and we celebrate .
and then there be little party .
big - uh , she sister do a big family party -- but try to keep that same Jane Ed local family come together .
it be amazing how they can get into little squabble and who do not show up Jane of course .
Ed like that .
I think it be crazy .
so , -lrb- -lrb- so , uh -rrb- -rrb- - Jane they use to always really all get together .
but he parent uh they actually live next door to we .
but they be start to get up in the year , so they be not , you know , host the big party , so it be funny how now people do not all bother to come Ed yeah .
Jane and you kind of wonder you know in the next couple of year what be all go to happen .
be they all go to see each other .
Ed yeah , no that be - that be exactly .
I have already see , you know , -lrb- -lrb- in -rrb- -rrb- my parent -lrb- -lrb- ' bed -rrb- -rrb- until they -lrb- -lrb- get -rrb- -rrb- less and less that the brother get together -- and then now when there be a event you try to do it .
at Christmas it be just impossible because we leave -- two day after Christmas Jane Mhm .
Ed to go out of the country as part of we New Year 's Jane Ed celebration .
so , for we it be , you know , get to be a quick trip up Jane Ed to she family and then back where we - -- we have be invite to be down in Jane Ed another country .
if a person be not - even though it be cold up in the Northeast , it be a family tradition .
I should do it -- and less for the gift and more for Jane Ed be together .
yeah .
Jane Well , we do - -- - for the kid you know we make it pretty cl - Ed I do not know , I think that be great .
Jane - you know , you do not have all the hassle of run around and be crazy and just kind of spend time together Ed and I think that be very - I mean , if - Jane and it be really pretty nice .
Ed yeah , we have not - -- yeah , I think -- e - e - eventually that may happen , the way we be go with , uh , Jane Ed my wife and I with she Jane Ed family .
not as a negative but as a - Jane Ed you know , we do a lot of travel so that be go to be - I think that be go to come up .
Jane Ed but - -- but for now we be still try to do - Jane Ed as long as the mother 's around , we will still do Christmas and act as - Jane Ed she be not really old , but she be get older , so I think that be one reason to stay together Jane Ed and also I think i - be Jane Ed eh , we - we kind of -- infuse a little family party that she sister have so -- I think if we be to go away both of those might fall off a little bit and it do not take but one year and then all of the sudden everybody 's Jane yeah .
Ed not come to it anymore and it be like a - Jane that be it .
that be the way it be .
Ed yeah , but not because - Jane if I be no - Ed it be - -- I - I enjoy the -- smile people and the festive - -- festive nature and -- I think it do get a little commercialized .
-lrb- -lrb- it be not that the - -rrb- -rrb- -- you can ignore that part of it , I guess .

I think it will still go through , you know .
the -- it be democracy , you know , you have to fight for it .
it be not -- it do not come easily , you know .
a Right .
yeah , that be why I think it will , too , because they - they push it in Iraq .
I mean , uh , excuse I , in Afghanistan .
they keep on schedule they and they we be say , oh , no no no , you know .
Allan Um , yeah , I think -- you know I think they should have continue to go through with it , and you know um -- if - if there be -- if there be problem , you know , just -- still -- do not , you know -- just ignore it , keep go , you know you can not -- stop , you know , if you already start something , you know , you should complete it , I think .
a Right .
Allan I mean , if they leave -- if they leave , you know , if the - eh , let 's say they , you know , they just leave right now , you know , the the -- they can not , you know , I do not think the -- the -- the occupant themselves regain control and , you know , and mo - and , you know , and -- put down the power and , you know , a - and control everything they can .
they just need they , you know , they need assistance and to get off -- get off , you know , on the right step .
I think they be go to need the military to be in there .
and assist they with the election and they need to complete the election and all this .
a yeah , um , yeah , I do not know what the end game , per se , be go to be there , you know , because , eh , they - the problem be the - be the culture , you know , it be -- pretty , uh , you know , it be really almost like a modern day crusade , you know , and that be - that be kind of hard , you know .
a lot of -- there be a lot of embitterment that go back generation and stuff , so , you know , we have -- I do not know , I always think we have such a short mindset , uh , but they do not .
so , that be why , uh , I - I do not know i - there be always go to be problem there , I just do not -- I do not know how long we should -- be in Iraq .
I mean , definitely to keep it stable .
I - -- eh , I just -- I - I think the situation could be handle better .
I - I think it be a great idea fir - they go in there -- and do what they do but , uh , they have a short window of opportunity to win over the people and it do not happen .
I do not know if that be just out of we control or - or what or if we could have do a better job but , uh , you know .
Allan do you support the -- do you - do you support the war ?
a what be that now ?
Allan do you support the war ?
a yeah .
yeah , I do at first I just - I just -- I -- do not like the way it be manage .
I think -- I think , uh , they do a great job up front , of course .
you know , they do militarily-wise , they do a excellent job but I think they have do a poor job , you know , reconstruct and just control the situation .
you know , they - Allan yeah , I - I agree also .
yeah , I - I mean , I - I do support the war .
I just think that when they go in there , you know they -- they just do not -- you know , they do not i - execute everything correctly , you know there be problem , you know .
a yeah .
Allan and I think I mean , that that lead to it , but yeah , I mean they -- I mean eh you know you be already in it , so you know , you should not -- you can not just walk down and , you know , stop , you get to complete what you be do , you know .
so I a right .
Allan yeah , um .
a but , they - they definitely need to take a back seat to some sort -- you know , some sort of iraqi government there .
I know they set up the council , uh , interim council , but that have not go , you know , perfe - smoothly .
um , they still -- Americans have be call the shot .
so , if they can just sort of make a -- be - get into more of a supportive role and , you know , flex they muscle when they need to and maybe that will help - help , uh , squall some of the vi - the violence .
I do not know .
eh , if they could have -- if they could have shore up the border , right after go in there , that would have be a -- that would have be a - a big plus , you know .
I do not know if that could , uh , if that be a -- plausible goal or not because , uh , it be just that - that -- a lot of that be , you know , uh , weapon and terrorist have be , you know , get through the border , probably from Syria .

JAKARTA , Indonesia -lrb- AP -rrb- the dictator Suharto have fall , the constitution have change , the media be unshackled , democratic election hold , and East Timor free .
after Sept. 11 , 2001 , Indonesia be quick to sign onto U.S. President George W. Bush 's global war on terror .
yet , Washington maintain a 12-year ban on arm sale to the world 's most populous muslim nation with the aim of curb human rights abuse still happen despite momentous political change .
frustrated , Jakarta 's general be look elsewhere to replace antiquated arsenal .
later this month indonesian President Megawati Sukarnoputri travel to Moscow to seek the Kremlin 's help in modernize she increasingly obsolete 300,000-member armed force .
she be also likely to open the way for russian company to vie for lucrative deal in the oil and gas sector , long dominate by american and british resource giant .
although opposite end of the Earth , Indonesia and Russia have some basic thing in common .
both be geographically sprawl with massive multiethnic population .
both be struggle to preserve national unity as they fight separatism and build democracy after the collapse of decade of authoritarian rule .
both be resource-rich , but face huge economic problem make worse by endemic corruption .
and , currently , both have oppose the U.S. - lead war on Iraq .
Indonesia 's Foreign Ministry spokesman Marty Natalegawa say Megawati 's meeting with Russian President Putin slate for April 21 will touch on the Iraq crisis .
but other diplomat say that issue will serve primarily to bring the two closer together on bottom-line issue such as trade and arm sale .
analyst worry that Indonesia 's military be now so degraded it can no longer control the border of the far-flung archipelago , allow for easy infiltration by extremist .
last year 's Bali bombing , which kill 202 people , illustrate the threat of terrorism in Indonesia .
and , broad opposition to the u.s.-led attack on Iraq threaten to lead to a backlash by militant Islamists .
`` nearly everybody in Indonesia see this Iraq war as completely unnecessary and there be widespread public opposition to U.S. policy , '' say Jusuf Wanadi of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta .
close tie between Moscow and Jakarta be not unprecedented .
Indonesia rely on soviet military assistance in the 1950s under Megawati 's father and found President Sukarno , but these be sever after the anti-communist Gen. Suharto seize power in 1965 .
the United States quickly become the southeast asian country 's main weapon supplier , and annual arm sale peak at us$ 400 million in the 1980 .
in 1991 , however , the U.S. Congress ban this after indonesian troops kill hundred of civilian in East Timor .
in 1999 , East Timor become free , but only after indonesian force lay waste to it as they withdraw after a pro-independence referendum .
the shocking level of destruction prompt U.S. lawmaker to expand the ban to cover almost all military tie with Indonesia .
since then some in the Bush administration _ particularly Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz , a former ambassador to Jakarta and a prime architect of the Iraq war _ have push for the ban to be repeal .
so far , U.S. lawmaker have reinstate only a limited officer training program .
but that be far from enough for Indonesia 's general .
`` I think the indonesian military have finally decide that restriction and conditionality from Washington be just not worth it , '' say Juwono Sudarsono , a former defense minister .
`` so they want to look for alternative source for plane , helicopter and other hardware . ''
Moscow have already have some success in woo Indonesia as a customer .
Jakarta have recently purchase some russian weapon , include 10,000 Kalashnikov assault rifle , a squadron of naval mil-2 helicopter and a dozen btr-80a amphibious carrier for its marine .
currently , Indonesia use short-range rapier missile purchase 30 year ago to protect its vital oil and natural gas field in Sumatra , Borneo and Papua from air attack .
`` replenish they have be a big problem , '' Sudarsono say .
Air defense commander want to augment the rapier with Russia 's impressive long-range s-300 missile , or shorter-range system such as the SA-15 Gauntlet or shoulder-fired igla .
the Air Force be reportedly consider purchase several squadron of Sukhoi su-27 interceptor , consider the world 's premier dogfighter .
previously , indonesian Air Force commander prefer western jet that be compatible with the u.s.-made f-16 fighter-bomber already in the indonesian inventory .
but neighbor Malaysia 's success in integrate russian mig-29 and american f/a -18 Hornets persuade they otherwise , Sudarsono say .
if Megawati do stiff-arm the United States on the weapon issue , it be unlikely relation with Washington will be permanently damage .
whatever happen , Indonesia , a mainly muslim but politically secular state , be natural ally in the struggle against terrorism and religious militancy .
what could be more worry for Washington be Russia 's economic ambition .
Trade between Indonesia and Russia increase by dlr 36.2 million to dlr 203.5 million in 2001 _ the last year for which statistics be available .
analyst say this can only grow .
the real concern , though , be in the petroleum sector .
Megawati and Putin be expect to sign agreement to give russian company a toehold in Indonesia 's oil and gas industry , long dominate by american and british giant such as Exxon Mobil and BP .
PRAGUE , Czech Republic -lrb- AP -rrb- the troubled nuclear power plant in Temelin receive permission from state authority Monday to start power production at full capacity .

participant include Kurds , Sunnis and Shiites from inside the country and other who spend year in exile .
U.S. official invite the group , which pick they own representative .
many Iraqis boycott the meeting in opposition to U.S. plan to install Garner atop a interim administration .
thousand of Shiites _ who constitute Iraq 's most populous religious group but be repress under Saddam Hussein _ demonstrate in nearby Nasiriyah , chant `` no to America and no to Saddam ! ''
`` Iraq need a iraqi interim government .
anything other than this trample the rights of the iraqi people and will be a return to the era of colonization , '' say Abdul Aziz Hakim , a leader of the largest iraqi shiite group , the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq .
U.S. official hope more Iraqis join the process and stress that this be just the first of many such meeting in Iraq .
the meeting conclude with the delegate vote by show of hand to meet again in 10 day .
a national conference be plan to select the interim administration , perhaps within week , a senior U.S. official say on condition of anonymity .
the interim administration could begin hand power back to iraqi official within three to six month , but form a government will take longer , say Maj. Gen. Tim Cross , the top british member of Garner 's team .
`` one have to go through the process of building from the bottom up , allow the leadership to establish itself , and then the election process to go through and so forth , '' Cross say .
`` that full electoral process may well take longer . ''
Garner 's Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance be charge with coordinate humanitarian assistance , rebuild infrastructure shatter by year of war and U.N. sanction , and gradually hand back power to Iraqis lead a democratically elect government .
Tuesday 's meeting be the first step toward that goal after the ouster of Saddam .
Sheik Ayad Jamal Al Din , a shiite religious leader from Nasiriyah , urge the delegate to craft a secular government , accord to a pool report .
but Nassar Hussein Musawi , a schoolteacher , disagree : `` those who would like to separate religion from the state be simply dream , '' he say .
iraqi exile Hatem Mukhliss quote President John F. Kennedy 's exhortation , `` ask not what you country can do for you , but what you can do for you country , '' and call on Iraqis to write a constitution , establish a legal system and consider what role the army should play .
he ask coalition representative to address problem of security , electricity and water in Iraq and help rebuild destroy and loot hospital .
`` Saddam reduce the country to such a state that it be necessary for people to sell off personal possession , '' Mukhliss say .
`` now it be time to take we country back . ''
there be already tension between the United States and some iraqi faction .
kurdish group appear unwilling to compromise on they demand to expand the border of they autonomous area to include the oil-rich city of Kirkuk and Kurdish part of the city of Mosul .
that could pose a problem for the United States , because Turkey worry that kurdish control of Kirkuk could lead to aspiration for independence and in turn encourage separatist Kurds in Turkey .
iraqi opposition leader fear the United States be try to force Ahmed Chalabi , head of the london-based umbrella iraqi National Congress , on they as leader of a new iraqi administration .
Chalabi be the first top iraqi opposition leader to be airlift by the U.S. military into southern Iraq as the fight wound down , and he and other top member of he group plan to meet soon in Baghdad .
U.S. official say Chalabi be bring in because he offer force to the coalition .
neither Chalabi nor many other leader of anti-saddam group attend Tuesday 's meeting , but they send delegate .
Iraqis protest the conference say it do not represent they interest .
the protester hold banner write in English and arabic say the `` Hawza , '' or the shiite religious seminary in Najaf , represent they .
even some of those at the meeting say they do not want Garner lead the interim administration .
`` we will press for any iraqi civilian administration regardless of what the Americans say .
a administration by Garner be not acceptable , '' say Mowaffak al-Rubaie , a iraqi physician and opposition activist .
he say american official have outline what Garner 's administration would look like : each ministry would be head by a american , either military or civilian .

the accident occur `` recently '' in chinese water east of the Neichangshan island , the brief chinese-language report say .
the island be in the Yellow Sea , between the northeastern province of Liaoning and North Korea .
the submarine be on a exercise when the accident occur , and `` because of a mechanical malfunction , the 70 crew member on board die , '' the Xinhua report say .
it do not give further detail or say how the crew die .
the vessel already have be tow back to a unidentified port , Xinhua say .
it say the hull number be 361 , which military analyst say appear to make it a ming-class submarine , a vessel use for patrol and coastal defense .
the announcement be unusual for a communist government that rarely acknowledge military accident .
it be the first time China have announce a fatal submarine mishap , say Bernard Cole , a professor at the U.N. National War College in Washington and a specialist on the chinese navy .
`` there have be rumor go around about the loss of submarine , but this be the first fatal accident that I know of , '' say Cole .
China 's military , which have a tradition of secrecy , do not comment about the accident Friday night .
foreign military analyst say it would be highly unusual for a accident to kill a whole submarine crew while still allow the vessel to be recover .
they suggest possible cause range from a sinking in shallow water to a disaster that flood the vessel with toxic chemical fume .
Michael McGinty , a expert on the chinese navy from the Royal United Services Institute for Defense study in London , say that the mishap likely happen while the submarine be on the surface .
if the accident happen when the vessel be underwater , it be less likely that China could have recover it , say McGinty , a former british submariner .
`` for a accident to have be so catastrophic when the submarine be on the surface , I find it a very mysterious thing , '' he say .
McGinty say that the submarine 's battery might have leak acid that mix with seawater , create toxic chlorine gas that kill the crew .
the torpedo might have leak propellant that poison the crew , he say .
the accident could have occur as long ago as March , say Cole , a former U.S. Navy antisubmarine warfare officer .
`` there have be exercise go on in the Yellow Sea over the past two month , '' he say .
`` this boat could have be involve in those exercise and go down over a month ago . ''
Cole say the loss of all hand suggest the vessel be flood or sink because of a collision or engineering problem .
he say ming-class sub usually carry a crew of 50 , suggest that the other aboard might have be technician or staff officer .
China begin build the ming-class sub in the 1970 , and they be obsolete by modern standard , accord to the Federation of American scientist .
the first three ming-class sub be complete between 1971 and 1979 , and one of they be scrap after a fire , accord to the web site of Jane 's Information Group , a lead of source defense information .
China be believe to have as many as 19 ming-class submarine .
China 's submarine fleet include 66 boat , most of they age diesel-electric vessel , McGinty say .
he say the fleet suffer from a chronic lack of money , training and maintenance .
but the Chinese be aggressively update they fleet with russian-made kilo-class diesel-electric sub .
`` the submarine force be the most potent part of the chinese navy , '' say Cole .
despite the difficulty of maintain a fleet , sub be valuable because they be hard to detect , Cole say .
in a conflict over Taiwan or some other confrontation , he say , `` China 's ability to field a force of even a dozen submarine could pose a big problem for any other naval force . ''
Xinhua say former President Jiang Zemin , who be chairman of the commission that run China 's military , on Friday send condolence to family member of the crew .

what the United Nations could contribute beyond humanitarian assistance be `` political facilitation , '' Annan say .

Planning for both the U.N. resolution and the international security force leave out France , Germany and Russia , three U.S. ally that vehemently oppose the war in Iraq .
some of the NATO member who agree to send troops may want NATO authorization for that action , the official say .

04-03-03 02:16:00 EST by EDWARD EPSTEIN c. 2003 SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE WASHINGTON _ have punch through severely deplete Republican Guard division that form Baghdad 's outer defensive ring , U.S. Army and Marine force be likely to pause again to test the iraqi capital 's inner defens and waall but evaporate under the weight of the U.S. assault .
they collapse leave the U.S. troops less than 20 mile from Saddam Hussein 's capital .
bet ` fow central command chief Gen. Tommy Franks and he field commander face a big decision _ whether to rush into the city of 5 million where Hussein 's regime have gather its most-trusted force or wait and see if the war can be win without pay the price of street-to-street urban fighting .
`` we be expectingn or at least planning for , a very difficult fight ahead , '' Gen. Stanley McChrystal say at the Pentagon Tuesday .
`` we be not expect to drive into Baghdad suddenly and seize it . ''
instead of a all-out assault , analyst expect the United States to follow the example of british force outside the southern iraqi city of Basra .
they be likely to mount small probe patrol into the city to determine the level of iraqi resistance .
if these patrol meet little opposition , thousand of troops could rush into the city .
if the Iraqis respond forcefully , the Army and Marine unit could withdraw and await the 4th mechanized Infantry Division , which will soon start move north from Kuwait .
while they wait , the force would try to determine where iraqi strong point be within the city and where Hussein might be , if he be still alive .
`` the Basra model will work for a while , at least until you see problem with food and water for civilian in the city , '' say Lawrence Korb , a analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations who be assistant defense secretary under former President Ronald Reagan .
`` before go in -lrb- with a full assault -rrb- , you have to decide if it be worth the risk , and ... you have to know who be there in the way of iraqi force and the amount of potential damage to civilian , '' he say .
the administration have say it want to minimize casualty to iraqi civilian , which make the british experience around Basra instructive , the analyst say .
the British have be outside the city of 1.5 million for more than a week .
thousand of refugee have flee the city , apparently provide information to the british that have lead to raid on military and Baath Party site in the city .
`` the key endgame may be whether the U.S. can parse out the key regime center of power in Baghdad and attack they without have to fight into the city , or at least locate they well enough to atman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies say in he daily war report .
U.S. strategist say that Hussein , if he be still alive and in control of he force , might like a bloody battle in Baghdad because such fighting could cause heavy U.S. casualty .
he last hope for survival might be that the United States lose its taste for such loss and force President Bush to negotiate a compromise that would allow Hussein and he family to keep power in Baghdad .
but Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution in Washington say the apparent collapse of Republican Guard resistance could deprive Hussein of much of the wallop he be count on in the city .
`` if U.S. force seriously degrade Iraq 's half-dozen Republican Guard division before that final battle , and only have to face perhaps 30,000 special Republican Guard , fedayeen , and related personnel , the task will not be as hard as it might have be , '' he say .
while two guard division have apparently be smash , there be three other in the Baghdad area .
a sixth remains in northern Iraq .
Cordesman say it seem the guard have be reinforce by unit from the regular iraqi army , which be generally view as less reliable .
this show the iraqi military 's grow weakness , he say .
`` the Republican Guard have take a massive hammering at every level and be now scatter and deploy somewhat erratically at the brigade level , '' he say .
the Iraqis still have not use chemical weapon , even though many expert fear such attack as the U.S. troops near Baghdad .
Korb , who be convinced Hussein have stock of chemical weapon he never report to U.N. inspector , say he would not be surprise if Hussein try to use they .
but he also say , `` he may destroy they to embarrass we , '' to show the world he never have such weapon and that Bush invade for no reason other than aggression .
the U.S. force zero in on Baghdad _ the 1st Marine Division from the east and the Army 's 3rd mechanized Infantry Division _ be train in urban warfare .
but in such close-quarter fight , they would lose much of the technological advantage of they air supremacy , which would have to be curtail because bombing in a city can cause large civilian casualty .
however , Baghdad from the air look like Los Angeles _ wide , straight boulevard intersect by side street in a grid pattern .
`` we force would be capable of deal with it reasonably .
but there would be lot of casualty on all side , '' Korb say .

WASHINGTON U.S. intelligence official now believe North Korea be develop the technology to make nuclear warhead small enough to fit atop the country 's grow arsenal of missides -lrb- potentially put Tokyo and U.S. troops base in Japan at risk , accord to official who have receive the intelligence report .
in the assessment , which they have share with Japan , South Korea and other ally in recent week , official at the Central Intelligence Agency say that U.S. satellite have identify a sophisticated new nuclear testing site in a area call Youngdoktong .
at the site , equipment have be set up to test conventional explosive that , when detonate , could compress a plutonium core and set onfe nuclear explosion .
-lsb- oma intelligence official believe that the existence of the testing range be evidence that the country intend to manufacture much more sophisticated weapon that would be light enough to put onto its grow arsenal of medium - and long-range missile .
previously , U.S. official have say they be uncertain whether North Korea have receive enough outside technical help to even attempt to make such a `` miniaturize '' nuclear warhead .
the new testing capability would suggest that the North Koreans be get closer _ now , official say , the intelligence report say they could do in in as little as a year or less .
but official say there be no sure way of know that they can until they actually test one .
senior administration official say that Washington have be try to convince Asiagent that it require a unified diplomatic front to force the country to give up its weapon .
the new intelligence be apparently be marshal to support the administration 's argument .
accord to official who have be brief on the U.S. report , conventional explosion simulate a nuclear detonation have be set off at the testing site , which be near North Korea 's main nuclear complex .
North Korea have never test a nuclear weapon , though the CIA long ago estimate that it manufacture two crude device in the late 1980s or early 1990 .
North Korea , unlike Iraq , have make no secret of its plan to develop nuclear weapon .
now , administration official say they fear that the country be on the verge of produce five or six new weapon , some of which might be miniaturize .
`` this would give they the range they never have before , and the chance to spread they threat far beyond South Korea , '' say one senior asian official , note that approximately 60,000 U.S. troops be base in Japan .
`` it change the dynamics of the problem . ''
the new intelligence estimate provide to asian ally , however , leave it unclear how quickly the North could produce the small warhead .
the worst-case estimate , official say , be that they could do so in less than a year .
-lrb- story can end here .

U.S. satellite have be watch north korean nuclear activity intently since late last year , when the North evict international inspector .
those inspector have stand guard over a collection of 8,000 spend nuclear fuel rod , which can be reprocess into weapons-grade plutonium .
in January the country begin to re-start its nuclear rexrogessing equipment , which have be mothbal for nearly a decade under a 1994 agreement with the Clinton administration .
but accord to U.S. official , it now appear that north korean engineer run into technical problem in restart the facility .
while intelligence official have reach no consensus , they tell ally last week that in the worst case , only a few hundred of the 8,000 rod have be convert into plutonium .
it would take 1,000 to 1,500 rod to make enough plutonium for a weapon , expert say.o `` what we be tell be that it would take perhaps six month after that to produce a miniaturize warhead , and put it into one of the missile , '' say one senior official who have recently review the intelligence .
`` but after Iraq , who know how good those estimate be ? ''
after the claim make about prohibit weapon in Iraq , which have not be find so far , skepticism about the quality of U.S. intelligence be widespread .
and in the case of North Korea , as in Iraq , the immediacy of the threat depend on whose analysis seem most compelling .
so far , U.S. intelligence have pick up almost no sign of the telltale krypton gas that be release into the atmosphere when nuclear fuel rod be convert into weapons-grade plutonium .
this have lead some analyst to argue that the North Koreans may be farther from produce a weapon than fear a few month ago .
but other note that truck be see carry the rod out of they normal storage area month ago , and it be unclear where they be _ or even whether the United States be sniff for the krypton gas in the right place .
`` we do not believe that the main reprocessing facility have be very active , '' say one senior administration official in a recent interview .
`` but could there be a second reprocessor ?
no one know for sure . ''
without question , though , North Korea 's capability greatly outstrip anything Iraq have have in the past decade , and North Korea 's program be probably several year ahead of Iran 's .
President Bush and South Korea 's new president , Roh Moo-h be unclear whether they interpret the meaning of that phrase the same way .
Bush have say he want a diplomatic solution to the problem , but would not foreclose any option , include military option .

BELFAST , Britain , April 8 -lrb- Xinhua -rrb- a two-day summit between british Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W. Bush end here Tuesday with both country try to minimize split on UN role in rebuild Iraq after the ongoing us-led war against the country be over .
as the us-led coalition troops be reportedly thrust into Baghdad and the second iraqi city of Basra , Blair and Bush agree there would be a `` vital role '' for the United Nations in post-war Iraq .
during they first war summit on March 27 at Camp David , Blair and Bush become divide over what a role the United Nations will play in postwar Iraq , when Bush give no positive reaction to Blair 's suggestion of a strong UN role .
after the Camp David talk , Blair , who analyst say have be pursue a special relationship with Washington in order to restore Britain 's traditional role as a transatlantic `` bridge '' , be force to readjust he tone .
Blair and Bush be expect to bridge they gap on the issue by reach a agreement on UN role in post-war Iraq , some analyst say even before this summit at Hillsborough , south of Belfast , the second of its kind since the war break out on March 20 .
in a joint write statement , the two ally pledge to seek UN Security Council resolution to affirm Iraq 's territorial integrity , ensure aid delivery and endorse a `` appropriate '' post - conflict administration for Iraq .
`` we welcome the appointment by the United Nations Secretary - General of a special adviser for Iraq to work with the people of Iraq and coalition representative , '' the statement add .
the United Nations would have a `` vital role '' in the effort to repair Iraq 's infrastructure , Blair tell reporter at a news conference after he talk with Bush , downplay UN role in emphasize that ultimately the country must be run by the iraqi people .
`` the key be that Iraq in the end should be govern by the iraqi people , '' Blair say , pledge that british and US force would not stay in the country `` a day longer than necessary '' .
it be a `` false choice '' to debate whether Iraq should be run by coalition force or the United Nations , say Blair , who be believe to be in favor of a stronger UN role in post-conflict Iraq than Bush .
echo Blair , Bush say the UN would play a role in all aspect of post-war Iraq , from humanitarian aid to a future interim authority , add that Iraq would `` move as quickly as possible '' to a interim authority make up of Iraqis from inside and outside the country .
however , when press on what precisely the UN role would be , Bush on Tuesday mention only humanitarian work , `` suggest '' people to staff the interim authority and help Iraq `` progress . ''
`` when we say vital role for the United Nations , we mean vital role for the United Nations in all aspect of the issue , whether it be humanitarian aid , or whether it be help to stand up a interim authority .
the iraqi people will decide who be on the iraqi interim authority , '' say Bush .
Bush do not spell out how much power the United Nations would have , nor do he elaborate on Washington 's plan to place US official alongside Iraqis in the interim administration .
difference still remain between the United States and Britain , analyst say , over the speed with which Iraq should be hand to a interim iraqi administration , and the extent to which a us-led group of general and former diplomat should effectively run the country .
yet , analyst argue , both Britain and the United States hope they agree vision of a postwar scenario will placate anti-war nation such as France , Germany and Russia .
`` we will move as quickly as possible to place governmental responsibility under the control of a interim authority compose of Iraqis from both inside and outside the country , '' Bush vow at the joint news conference with Blair , add that the interim authority would serve until a permanent government could be choose by the iraqi people .
`` rebuild of Iraq will require the support and expertise of the international community .
we be commit to work with international institution , include the United Nations , which will have a vital role to play in this task , '' Bush add .
Blair also plead the world to avoid `` endless diplomatic wrangle '' over the future of Iraq like the international dispute over a second UN resolution on Iraq that precede the war .
France and Germany , which be most vocal in oppose this US - lead war against Iraq , have be insist that the United Nations should play a central role in the phase of post-war Iraq .
on the unresolved dispute between Europe and the United States , analyst say , Blair might again have to make a difficult choice , but he be very likely to support the United States , which Britain can not afford to fall out with .

D. Spencer Hines lux et veritas et libertas vires et honor tiglath 31 Jan 2005 10:40:52 -0800 Re : good morning Iraq Let 's see ... there two main quality to be desire in a commander-in-chief , generalship and leadership .
because in the United States the commander-in-chief be a purely political post , generalship be usually undertake by the general proper under the Commander-in-Chief , provide it be understand that the commander-in-chief be ultimately responsible and accountable for the outcome of he general 's generalship .
generalship involve the technical skill of intelligence gathering , strategic and tactical planning , and the communication of order .
leadership can be less rigidly define and be concern less with coordination than motivation and how a commander seek to inspire he man to fight harder and endure worse privation in order to beat the enemy .
President Bush generalship have prove deficient .
he planning for the war be inadequate and he monitoring of the war after the invasion fail to correct course in the face of the change in circumstance bring by a strong and unexpected insurgency .
the Commander-in-Chief 's generalship can suffice to motivate man if they be higly confident that he be a very capable and skilled general .
Eisenhower be in that position .
that have not be the case with President Bush , who unleash hell act on faulty intelligence , fail to find any wmd , and leave we boy at war want for armor .
that be not the sort of generalship that on rational grounds alone motivate man to march to possible death .
men unmotivated by bad generalship can still be motivate by exceptional leadership .
in theory , motivation be best carry out by a commander fight alongside he man .
make no mistake , even when we do not desire a president with a preference for personal combat , the need for a commander to be see to share danger with he man be as imperative today as it be in time of Alexander of Macedon .
that be why we look at the military record of we leader .
John Kennedy , George H. Bush , and even John Kerry , the loser , have distinguish military career that be apt substitute for lead man in battle .
the knowledge that the commander-in-chief once face grave danger in war bravely can be the animate spirit of troops face the same danger .
George W. Bush have no distinguished military career .
in fact , CBS and carrier landing notwithstanding , there be every indication that in the peak of youth he avoid the danger of war as much as he could .
that be not the sort of leadership that on emotional grounds alone motivate man to march to possible death .
some might say that George W. Bush be neither a general nor a soldier , he be a politician .
he be in charge of Grand Strategy and he delegate the rest .
true .
but as commander-in-chief he be the Ultimate General and the First Soldier .
George W. Bush , the politician , be not very good at grand strategy either .
the aim of grand strategy be a prosperous and secure peace , and by he several blunder over the psychology of he opponent , the political and economic effect of he action , and the failure to erradicate terrorism and even capture he most wanted terrorist , George W. Bush , he have fail to realize the aim of grand strategy .
I will be glad if Iraq become a truly democratic country .
but will it ?
and at what price ?
be you willing to pay with a deficit of billion , thousand of Americans dead or badly wound , and the unmeasurable disruption that a foreign war cause to the life of we nation at all level , for each country in the world that be in the grip of a tyrant ?
I be not .
let those country grow a generation with the gut and the willingness to originate democratic change and I will support join other nation to back the ef .
but unilaterally , or worse lead a coalition feature tyranny , effect such change remain a bad idea , Iraq 's election notwithstanding .
George W. Bush do not do well in the industrial private sector where success be measure by return on investment .
Government suit such a man perfectly ; there be no balance sheet to worry about .
there be every indication that the new ruler of Iraq will do business as usual under a democratic varnish .
the interim government do not hesitate to torture opponent , just like Saddam do .
the Shiites will be no different .
that will be we return on investment .
Iraq wield democracy like Britney Spears wield the electric guitar , it look cool and trendy but she have no idea of how to play it .

Indonesia warn about tsunamis EW Tue , 28 Dec 2004 09:09:36 -0500 Re : Indonesia warn about tsunami `` Minutes after a massive earthquake rock the indian ocean on Sunday , international ocean monitor know that a tsunami would likely follow .
but they do not know whom to tell .
`` we put out a bulletin within 20 minute , technically as fast as we could do it , '' say Jeff LaDouce of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .
LaDouce say e-mail be dispatch to indonesian official , but he do not know what happen to the information . ''
it look more like the indonesian official be not sit at they computer or do not have they email client set for 10 minute check for new mail .
email !
for Heaven 's sake , get with the real world .
it be too bad those NOAA people have not use the telephone .
I wonder if the -lrb- few -rrb- live they could have save if they would use a modicum of common sense will prey on they mind .
Joe727 Tue , 28 Dec 2004 14:46:35 GMT Re : Indonesia warn about tsunamis Well , I have yet to hear that scientist from any other country even make the attempt the american scientist make .
perhaps the indonesian government should have take step to set up a hotline of sort that could be use in case of such emergency .
as the article note , the american scientist do not know who to contact .
that be hardly they problem , let alone they fault .

how would you react to such a call ?
I think so .
all the more reason that the indonesian government should have take step to set up a hotline of sort that could be use in case of such emergency .
Joe Eugene Gallagher Tue , 28 Dec 2004 10:38:02 -0500 Re : Indonesia warn about tsunami the Boston Globe point out that New England have no system in place to warn resident of tidal wave , which be know to happen off New England .

Joe727 Tue , 28 Dec 2004 15:47:40 GMT Re : Indonesia warn about tsunami the entire East Coast of the U.S. do not have a tsunami warning system .
Joe William Asher 28 Dec 2004 16:36:47 GMT Re : Indonesia warn about tsunami on the other hand , if you be a scientist at NOAA and be into save people from tsunami , you would think you might have figure out beforehand who you might call if you do get some advanced warning of such a event .
also , the indonesian government probably have no idea that NOAA could give they advanced warning of tsunami so how could they know they should set up a hotline .
so it cut both way , the indonesian government should have do some prior planning , but so too should the NOAA scientist .
you can bet they be figure out who they should have call next time .

Christopher Reeve could have die from a allergic reaction moria fri , 18 Feb 2005 16:20:11 GMT Re : Christopher Reeve could have die from a allergic reaction Lovely , she refuse a autopsy which could prove how she husband die , but then she turn around and make accusation like this against he treatment , and in effect , he doctor .
this make I super piss off .
the sypmtom of a massive allergic reaction and of a systemic infection be completely different .
yet suddenly , she be a expert .
statement like this on show like Oprah , who love to spread medical ignorance , be completely irresponsible .
Karen 18 Feb 2005 09:41:42 -0800 Re : Christopher Reeve could have die from a allergic reaction I do not see this as a accusation but a explanation .
people can have allergic reaction to med they have not react to before without anyone know it will happen .
it be the exposure to the substance that cause the allergy to form .
like people walk through poison ivy half they life then suddenly have a bad reaction to it .
like the thousand of people develop allergy to latex these day , etc. .
I see that show and do not think she be accuse anyone of anything , more try to explain to people why he die so suddenly .
she mention several time how wonderful he doctor and nurse and therapist have be and mention they by name .
aee1...@yahoo.com 18 Feb 2005 10:11:49 -0800 Re : Christopher Reeve could have die from a allergic reaction there be no accusation by she .
she say there be a couple of drug that they have use with Chris in the past to treat he infection with no problem , and they would use they again and he would have a allergic reaction .
it happen a lot .
she say she do not want a autopsy because there be no blame , she know it be just he body shut down .
drug he be not allergic to in the past would suddenly cause massive problem when they try to use they for a new infection .
she have nothing but praise and gratitude for all he doctor , nurse and care giver .
moria fri , 18 Feb 2005 18:19:14 GMT Re : Christopher Reeve could have die from a allergic reaction again , a true allergic reaction and a infection have different symptom .
she be say all the doctor and other professional be wrong and she be right .
also , if any drug cause adverse effect , those effect be suppose to be report to the FDA so future drug user can be alert to posible consequence .
if she truely believe what she be say -lrb- and wa not just talk out of she ass and probably display she denial about she husband 's illness -rrb- she would allow proper datum to be gather so it could be use to help other .
Carrie Fri , 18 Feb 2005 14:15:29 -0500 Re : Christopher Reeve could have die from a allergic reaction Christopher Reeve have a rare disorder call Mastocytosis .
drug sensitivity be one of the difficulty of that disorder .
since they know he have it , that be probably why she be not question this issue .
I often wonder how he be do with all the med because of he illness , which develop before he paralyze accident .
it be actually a testament to he stamina and he doctor that he be able to survive as long as he do with this disorder complicate he care .
Karen 18 Feb 2005 11:59:26 -0800 Re : Christopher Reeve could have die from a allergic reaction I be not sure about this disagreement you be speak of between she version and the doctor version of he cause of death .
maybe the dr.s have hypothesize possibility at the time of death and in the month since then , they may think of other reason I do not know .
I know about allergic reaction and med , I have be a nurse for 20 year .
and I get a little defensive myself when a hear a layperson -lrb- although she probably have more knowledge than most about she husband 's diagnosis and treatment -rrb- talk like a expert on tv without know all the detail .
but as I say , I see the show and do not get that feeling at all that she be be in any way accusatory or blame .
she also be not come off as a know-it-all .
this part of the interview be very off-hand and informal feeling , more like gosh , I do not think we will ever know , maybe it be this , it could have be that .
it be more that she know many people care about she husband and want to know what he last hour be like .
I know not everyone be enthral with Dana Reeve , but she have win many people 's respect .
people be interested to know how she be do after have lose such a big part of she life , and this really be more what the interview be about .
maryanne kehoe sit , 19 Feb 2005 20:33:41 -0500 Re : Christopher Reeve could have die from a allergic reaction what I think be quite appalling from what Dana say on the Oprah show be that the doctor want to pull the life support from Chris * without she be there .
* what in god 's green earth would make a medical professional say such a heartless thing to a soon-to-be-grieving widow ?
that doc should lose he medical license -- what a bastard .

the old wedding problem Lee Paulson Mon , 3 Jan 2005 08:54:47 -0500 the old wedding problem two of my nephew be exclude from they brother 's wedding this weekend because they be not lds .

both be extremely hurt , particularly since they know they brother could have have a civil ceremony and then be marry in the temple later .
I be offend because one of those nephew and I be very close , and he be really upset .
the groom say `` it be not quite what I have expect . ''
the bride be not quite able to speak in front of stranger , so I do not know what she think .
she do tell my niece that she think she husband be a good catch -- rm attend BYU and all that .

Ralph Waldo Emerson Peggy Tatyana Mon , 3 Jan 2005 10:17:10 -0700 Re : the old wedding problem that be sad , Lee .
I really think it be time for the church to admit that a civil ceremony follow by a temple seal reach the same goal , often in a more loving way , than insist that only the seal be worth do .
a change of that sort would be very simple to implement , and most church member would like it better than allow non-lds family member into the temple , which would actually be my preference .
there be be a thread recently in one of the exmo fora about a woman whose bishop , who she have be plan to have marry she , be go out of town , so she ask the stake president , who she do not know well .
he insist that he need to make the point , as part of perform the ceremony , that she really need to be marry in the temple , even though she fiance be not lds .
she ultimately decline he service .
how to get the message across to young people that consider the feeling of they family be just as important as be seal for time and all eternity ?
I do not know .
it would have to be some sort of grassroot movement , I think , since it be not likely to come through official , correlate channel .

from a family standpoint it sound liek a good decision , harmony and all that ... plus the temple ceremony could be seal a year later .
unfortunately we start off on the wrong foot for a lot of reason and the marriage do not last .
I can not help but wonder if perhaps we do ourselves a diservice by not get sealedi ntially , and make we marriage a gospel focus one .
who be to say .
it be a tough decision to make and despite the feeling I myself cave I feel people should be understand of the rationale .
for my part if we have be seal intially there simply would not have be anyone there and both we family have harsh feelign about the church as be , and a sealign would have only create more disharmony .
for my part though , I think we start the marriage with a compromise and dein ourselves tremendous blessing and ultimately pay the price .
Peggy Tatyana Mon , 3 Jan 2005 11:34:00 -0700 Re : the old wedding problem hmm ... I wonder how many success story be out there from people who choose to have a civil ceremony , and go on later to be happily seal .

they be still together after more than 55 year .
divorce be really stupid ... dogbirdh...@yahoo.com 13 Jan 2005 09:51:33 -0800 divorce be really stupid ... I think divorce be really stupid .
it will take I awhile to get to think stream that get I to that think today .
First off , I be remarry , divorce 3 year ago .
I love my wife , and the kid get along just fine .
I do not like my exwife .
but there be a time when I do like she ; in fact I love she very much in spite of she numerous flaw , chief among those flaw be that she be a narcicist .
but we all have some sort of personality problem ... .
my wife belong to a support group , and just for fun , they all google they hubby ex 's .
somehow , this lead I to google my ex 's boyfriend , call he B. and there he be , talk about plan with he wife and kid .
wow .
to I , b be just this one dimensional guy that be be drag along by my exwife .
now , he turn out to have a 3 dimensional life too .
I guess we all do .
I would like to take he out for a beer sometime .
it would be fun .
I wonder what happenn to b 's son ?
my kid never mention b have a son .
b 's son be apparently 16 year old , same age as my daughter .
I wonder if b have a huge messy divorce , and he ex take the kid out of state .
my ex threaten that .
Ouch .
divorce really suck .
I have my kid almost 50/50 these day , but it be a huge messy post divorce compromise that take a year to complete .
I wonder if b have to go through some of the same kind of shit ?
perhaps my exwife have more sympathy for what its like to be a guy on the receive end of a divorce now ?
Ok , keep googling .
oh my , the plot thicken .
I find b 's exwife .
very articulate writer .
this be really humorous .
she write a article about a divorce support group , end it with something about Mrs. B be happily married but she be impress by the divorce support group .
and that be only 4 year ago !
Mr. and Mrs. B have a real life too .
they share dream together , raise a kid , and probably have a lot of fun together .
now I be even more curious about the b 's kid .
she still live in town here .
maybe there be some sort of terrible tragedy ???
I will have to ask about b 's kid when my own kid switch off next week .
sometimes we want to see marriage one dimensionally .
either its bad or good .
that be total bullshit .
I know my first marriage have a lot of good adventure , a lot of friendship , a lot of love .
oh , yeah , it be not perfect .
my exwife be a total pain in the ass much of the time , and I try to let she do what she want , sometimes I could not .
but , even to the end , we love each other .
and now , I see the lose family tie .
she be lose my family , I be slowly drift out of touch with she family .
we both build new life .
New live .
but you know , as long as the kid be share , you can not total get this exspouse out of you mental psyche .
they say it take one year for every two that you be marry .
I believe that .
meanwhile , life go on .
my wife 's name be M. we be go to a bed and breakfast this weekend , to get away , relax .
m and I be slowly build a history of we own together .
we share adventure together , we share adventure with my kid , and with we dog .
and , I take lot of picture .
I really have not change very much from who I be before .
although , the dog thing be really post divorce .
lot and lot of picture .
sometimes I look at the old photo , before divorce .
we smile together , laugh , hug .
I be one of the first digital camera user , and I have too many photo from my first marriage .
sometimes I feel like I be race to create enough photo of my new life to outweigh the long history of my first life .
that be go to take awhile ... luckily , we flaw human being live long live , and digital camera take lot and lot of picture !
if my exwife do not dump b , maybe they will wind up stay together , maybe even get marry .
I think that would be nice .
and they too will begin the process of rebuild they `` together '' life .
I be assume there be some humanity beneath my exwife 's narcicistic shell , but I do believe there be .
b seem like a decent enough person too .
so , b and my ex will be do the same thing that I be do .
rebuild they life .
anyway , all of this get I back to my original point .
divorce seem really really stupid .
it seem to I , that beneath it all , we all want the same thing .
love , companionship , and a partner for we life 's journy .
none of this make total sense to I .
but I just think I would ramble .

13 Jan 2005 10:49:39 -0800 Re : divorce be really stupid ... you post make I horribly sad .

-- I live in a 961 sq. ft. apartment .
my ex have most all of the photo as we son live there and it be he history .
I do get a good bunch of the wedding photo , but my ex refuse to give they all to I say it be `` he life too '' even though I really resent they be under the same roof with he child-bride .
I be sure they be take lot of picture of they trips/vacations/whatever -lrb- at least 2 that I know of -rrb- .
I do not own a camera .
he new inlaw be all former family friend I do not have anything to do with anymore for obvious reason .
he family -lrb- brother , sister , stepmother -rrb- conveniently seem to forget that for almost 20 year I be a member of they family .
there be no gradual `` drift of out touch '' despite the fact that we all live in the same city and my ex BIL and I even work within block of each other .
my family think my ex be pond scum but because my parent be still member at the same church , they have to see my ex and he new wife every week .
my mother take he remarriage harder than I do , I think , because of that .
divorce * be * really stupid .
duh-uh .
especially for those of we who still have so many year -lrb- if one year for every 2 marry , then I have still get another 7 or so -rrb- to go to get we head screw back on and find some sort of life that rival what we have or what we ex have or what you and you ex have .

the only tort reform that i think should be do be to cap fee that lawyer be allow to extract for class action suit .
i feel that there be a valuable public service that come from class action suit which be to keep company on the straight and narrow so that they avoid such action ... but from a monetary perspective the only real winner from class action be the lawyer .
i remember once receive a fifty cent check in a envelope with postage of at least half that amount for the great 17 '' monitor class action suit .
Ben Myers Mon , 28 Feb 2005 01:58:35 GMT Re : Dell sue for `` bait and switch '' and false promise then there be the class action suit against Gateway bring by some Philadelphia lawyer a number of year ago .
gateway advertise and sticker many of its 486 computer as `` Pentium Ready '' , mean that a special type 3 zif socket Pentium OverDrive could be install and run .
Micronics design the motherboard use by Gateway , and the basis of the design be a prototype Pentium OverDrive with a internal write-through cache , a more conservative cache design .
then Intel change the Pentium OverDrive , and the final version have a write-back cache .
when install in a Gateway system , the chip run slower than slow , maybe about as fast as a IBM AT , and bus-mastering device like nic and scsi card refuse to work .
so the lawyer sue Gateway , and the settlement approve by the judge consist of megabuck for the lawyer and coupon to owner of Gateway 486 computer .
the coupon be good for $ 50 off on the purchase of a Pentium OverDrive processor from Gateway , at its usual inflated price !!!
so , let 's see .
what do a discount coupon for a processor I can not use in my system do for I ?
I wonder how many people gleefully cash in they coupon and buy Pentium OverDrives from Gateway .
Intel eventually compensate by make available a `` interposer '' , a little socketed thingie install between the Pentium OverDrive and the zif socket .
the sole purpose of the interposer be to raise a signal on the CPU to force its cache to operate in the write-thru mode which be compatible with most zif socket 3 486 motherboard .
needless to say , this be the least successful `` OverDrive '' CPU ever do by Intel .
the 486-dx4 overdrive be ok , as be several socket 5 Pentium OverDrives and the socket 8 Pentium pro OverDrive .
finally Intel give up on overdrive ... Ben Myers Nascar12 Sun , 27 Feb 2005 22:45:13 -0500 Re : Dell sue for `` bait and switch '' and false promise believe it or not there be company that go over the line and need to be hit with a stick call a law suit .
it seem the fear of law suit be the only thing that keep some of these crooked company in line .
the government sure do not have the resource or desire to pursue they so it be leave to the private sector to protect themselves .
lawyer be bounty hunter of sort .
BTW , I hate lawyer but there be time that they be useful .
some be sleazebag but that can be say of most profession .
there have to be at least a little threat of `` let the company beware '' to maintain a balance otherwise it will be open season on consumer .
Jerry Park Mon , 28 Feb 2005 13:12:59 -0600 Re : Dell sue for `` bait and switch '' and false promise the only people who profit from class action be the lawyer .
since company be go to be sue in class action , regardless of the merit of the case , the threat of a class action be not a detriment .
if you do not believe that , witness the Vioxx lawsuit .
the company make Vioxx determine it might increase mortality and pull it from the market .
because of that , it be be sue .
the company make similar drug -lrb- Celebrex and Bextra -rrb- do not pull they product from the market .
they be not be sue .
do the right thing provide no protection from class action .
all class action do be enrich lawyer and raise cost to everyone .
the cost of class action be factored into the cost of everything you buy .
OT best organization for donation David Case Sat , 8 Jan 2005 23:33:33 -0700 OT best organization for donation I would like to make a donation to help the survivor of the tsunami .
I have a lot of skepticism with the Red Cross and a few other base on horror story I have hear report in the media .
because of this I have always shy away from these national organization and stick with local group .
any thought as to where my money would go the furthest .
appreciate any input .
David Berman Sun , 9 Jan 2005 01:06:03 -0800 Re : OT best organization for donation I have hear mostly positive thing about how the Red Cross be handle they donation , with a very high percentage of the donate fund go directly for relief and not for administrative expense .
so that be the channel we choose for we own donation .
for what it be worth to you , here be some contact information for a few agency that seem to be highly regard .
the habitat for Humanity might be a good one to consider , since they expertise be in build housing , which of course be so beadly need over there at this time : American Red Cross : disaster Relief Fund , P.O. Box 37243 , Washington , DC 20013 .

-- best from David in NV Sam D. Sun , 9 Jan 2005 04:47:53 -0800 Re : OT best organization for donation actually more of the money from you donation have a chance of go directly toward its intended purpose than any other charity .
the Red Cross normally deduct 9 % from all deduction for its administratice cost .
it have announce that it will forego the 9 % on donation earmark for tsunami relief and that 100 % of these fund will go directly toward aid .
9 % in administrative cost would place the Red Cross among charity organization make the the most efficient use of donate fund .
the figure for most charity be 10-16 % .
I do not know what negative story about the Red Cross you have hear .
but nothing be 100 % and no organization of any kind be perfect .
just because of its size , which dwarf most other charity , I would assume that the Red Cross may be responsible for proportionately more blunder than most other charitable organization .
------------------------------ ------------ as tragic as the earthquake and tsunami in South Asia have be , it be truly uplifting to see how so many people have open they heart and so generously respond to the call for help toward disaster relief effort .
money from private donation have be flow into charitable relief organization at a unprecedented rate , in some case by million of dollar per hour .
`` tsunami aid '' be the fourth most frequently use term use in internet search last week .
although the need for help be still continue , some individual charity have announce that they have already receive as much in donation as they can put to use for this effort .
the follow announcement be receive from MSF `` doctor without borders/medecins san Frontieres -lrb- MSF -rrb- have receive a extraordinary outpouring of support for the people of South Asia and we be extremely grateful .
as you know , it be very important to MSF that we use you contribution as you intend it to be use .
this be why we want to let you know that at this time , msf estimate that we have receive sufficient fund for we currently foresee emergency response in South Asia . ''
Thomas W. Sun , 09 Jan 2005 21:55:27 +0100 Re : OT best organization for donation I have read that too - unfortunate , because I have work with they in Rwanda and be very impressed with the professionalism of they organization .
they also state that there be lot of place in the world where they continue to work which need plenty of help too - quite a important reminder because other needy area of the world be get less donation now .
so they do not discourage donation to they per se , just not for this specific area .
of course I realize that most people will want to help where the need for it be the most immediate .
all in all , the statement have confirm my view that doctor without border ia a very professional operatoin .
Thomas W. Don Strevel Sun , 9 Jan 2005 14:48:56 -0700 Re : OT best organization for donation no org be perfect .
we news system thrive on find a chinc in the armor of a organisation , a not perfect organisation .
they need rating and will do anything for it .
IMHO , go with the Red Cross , or any other national organisation .
just give carefully .
if you be go to give assistance then look with suspicion at all they do it be better to keep you $ $ $ .
all you have do be to buy a difficult time .

no doubt be the law in Q since it be extend from be drunk in charge of a horse .
it be also be rigorously police for as long as I can remember .
note also that have the drunken fool attempt to sleep it off out of the car he would have be cart off to clink for a different offence .
have he be see consuming alcohol in public he would have be do for that as well .
as every queenslander know ... if we do not have the toughest law outside Islam the place would be roll with drunk !

what about if he put the key in the ignition to turn to accessory to listen to the radio ?

I think this law be fairly well know , as long as you do not have the key on you be ok .
surely everyone have hear the trick of roll the front wheel over the key .
chance be sleep it off in the car will not be terribly effective because you will most likely be over 0.05 the next morning anyway .

McGill say the law say so .
in Q he be in charge of the car from the moment he attempt to put the key in the door lock .
if he be asleep in the back seat with the key in he possession then he be the person in charge of the car .
the offence be be drunk in charge of a vehicle -- as distinct from be drunk while operate a vehicle -lrb- which be a separate offence -rrb- .
the way to avoid be charge be to give the key to someone else to unlock the door and have they hang on to the key until you be below .05 .
the standard ruse be to throw the key under the car after you have unlock the door -lrb- which you can later claim be unlock by a person unknown -rrb- .
in this case the offender escape conviction first time around because it be accept that he attempt to get rid of the key , which supposedly land in he lap .
Judge McGill get it right as the law stand .

just try to understand here ... give this quote : '' .
do that mean if I be at home alone get piss with the car key on the coffee table and the car park outside , that I be `` in a position to drive the vehicle if I choose to do so without first take charge of it from some other person '' and can therefore be charge ?
sure , no reasonable cop would do that , but just strictly talk from the law side of thing .
or do the fact that I be on private property change that ?
or what if I be in a bar with the car outside , key in my pocket , but I have decide I will take the train home later ?
it would be a pretty sad state of the law if they could come in , ask for the owner of car rego `` xxx-999 '' and breathalise I because I have the key in my pocket .

where be the fundamental difference ?
same as if the pistol be in the safe and the gelly be lock in the shed .
so long as you do not attempt to access either any charge be not likely to stick .
I be remind of when I live in another state and the local cop charge the town drunk in he driveway after follow he home from the pub .
the drunk be acquit on the technicality that he be not on a public road when the cop arrest he .
would not have happen under Qld law -- and should not have happen anywhere else .
so whose law be stupid ?
Agreed , and not likely to happen in Q. you be deem to be in charge of the vehicle from the moment you attempt to put the key in the door lock .
sound fair enough to I -- especially since most queenslander be well aware of the law .

the pain of Childbirth Anna mc thu , 20 Jan 2005 10:04:19 +0100 the pain of Childbirth I have 2 girl already , nearly 8 and 4.5 yr and I have always say I will never forget the pain of childbirth .
Abby be a true water birth -lrb- 3kg - normal -rrb- and with Fiona I be drag out of the pool after the head crown -lrb- gyno have write on my note she be 4kg -lrb- large -rrb- and that she be not to be bear in the water -lrb- long painful story ! -rrb-
I can still remember though the pain I feel .
I be on the large side but I be so worried about how I be go to cope with a natural childbirth without a pool -lrb- not available round here -rrb- .
I have see video and hear of lady who have `` manage '' they pain control .
how in Heavens name can you do that ?
I have be there ; I know what the pain feel like !!
can anyone give I advice or let I know of any technique which might be able to help ?
thanks in advance .
Anna mc Dagny Thu , 20 Jan 2005 06:08:30 -0500 Re : the pain of Childbirth if you do not have a institutional water birth available , have you consider just stay home ?
unassisted or midwife attend ?
I understand hypnobirthing can be very helpful .
I be not pursue it because I be able to go inside the pain to the good place without training , last time .
I have not be think much about the hard part of labor prior to get so close .
now I remember how intense it be .
I think I be still look forward to it more than fear it , but hey .
it be a really intense , vulnerable thing .
-- Dagny Welches Thu , 20 Jan 2005 15:52:49 GMT Re : the pain of Childbirth if you go for a home birth you can rent a birthing pool .
I would not necessaritly say that you will have a repeat labour !
my first labour I be 30 hour and have a epidural after 22 hour .
# 2 I go in say `` give I the epidural asap-and never get to the state where I feel that I need it .
only have ten and gas-and-air .
so do not give up on the idea of a natural birth because last time be painful .
I think different people/different labour be different , so just because one person say `` I do *** and it do not hurt a bit '' do not mean that it will work for someone else , so go in with a set of suggestion , and be prepare to try they and see which be the best be probably the most helpful .
-lrb- oh and `` it do not hurt a bit '' be usually help by mummy amnesia !!

instead , if the cop pick she up , she can be ship back without delay .
Might be time to find a new girlfriend ... this one seem to have a habit of duck out when thing get rough .
Eliyahu Michael Jacobs Mon , 06 Dec 2004 10:08:56 -0500 Re : waiver of extradition mean what she be go to have a lot of separate offens to account for by this time .
2 `` fta `` s -lrb- failure to appear -rrb- , one in fl and one in AZ , plus whatever the original charge be in both case .
that mean she have give up the right to force the fl authority to go thru legal due process in demand that the AZ authority turn she over to they for further prosecution .
all the fl prosecutor have to do be ask , and the AZ jailer will pack she up in a van or a plane and ship she back to fl for trial on the FTA charge and probably to commence she serve time under the suspend sentence that go along with she original probation .
she be in DEEP SH __ t if you have not already figure that out .
nowhere in USA would be far enough if she waive extradition .
of course they do .
that be what she waiver of extradition mean they could do .
they let she serve she time in AZ , then they come and get she to serve she time in fl .
this be what happen when people blow off the chance they be give to straighten out by be give probation .
thumb you nose at the court often enough , and they will bring all sort of crap down on you head , re-institute the original suspend sentence and possibly add on for the FTA .
what be it good for ?
it be good for the state , not for the convict .
it let they skip some of the legal procedure she would otherwise be entitle to , in order to ship she from one state to another .
but they be entitle to demand that waiver as a condition of probation ; if she have not agree to voluntarily waive that right , they probably would have just throw she in jail for the 3 year sentence the first time around and she would not have be give the chance to go straight during probation and avoid jail altogether .
she do not have a lot of leeway here .
she have do this numerous time and they be not likely to give she another wide open chance like they do the first 3 time .
she will probably have to serve out she sentence in fl , and if she have not already serve all she time in AZ , they will then ship she back there to do that time .
Waitaminit , you say she do have a public defender ?
ok , he/she be do all they can , but that be not much , under the circumstance .
you be complain that you can not get a atty ?
you do not need one .
and she atty will not talk to you because you be not entitle to participate in they confidential communication with they client .

question regard simple assault & battery Annie Juhlyn Simon Sat , 29 Jan 2005 22:25:56 -0500 question regard simple assault & battery my roommate be hospitalize in mid-November for lung surgery and spend several day on load of pain medication .
on the fourth day of he stay , he be move out of the icu to the step-down unit , with a diagnosis of `` ICU Psychosis secondary to narcotic administration '' and post thoracostomy . ''
he be confuse , because of the medication but be not aggressive or threatening in any manner .
I see he each day and as soon as we speak , he become orient and be perfectly fine .
this be witness by both the nursing staff and he doctor .
during the early evening hour of he sixth hospital day , he get up , dress , pull he chest tube out and manage to get out of the hospital and across four lane of busy evening traffic , to we apartment .
by the time he get to we home , he be very short of breath and there be a nurse and orderly who tell I `` he be crazy and just walk out . ''
I sit he down on the couch and talk to he , and ask he what have happen .
he say he would ask for something for pain and they tell hime he could not have anything .
then the orderly be apparently rude to he , and that be when he get up and decide to come home .
a short time later , two police officer show up and tell I they have to take he back to the hospital .
he go back with the officer , give they no problem at all .
I receive a call from the shift supervisor who tell I they would replace he chest tube , give he some pain medication and he be do much better .
I tell she to pass on the other shift that if he become confused or upset to call I , and I would talk to he , and get he settle down .
at 2:15 the next morning , I receive a call from the night shift supervisor who tell I my friend have be `` verbally abusive and aggressive '' and would I come over and talk to he .
so , I go over there , get to he room right at 2:30 .
there be two cop there and I ask what have happen .
my roommate be in bed , sound asleep , and have all of he clothes on .
a nurse say , `` he beat two of we up .
the cop be here because we be press charge . ''
I have live with this man 9 year and never in that time have I ever see he be aggressive , violent or abusive in anyway .
I ask to speak to the two nurse whom he would alledgedly hit and be tell I could not do that .
a hour or so pass and the get my roommate out of bed , take he chest tube out and discharge he .
he be send to another hospital with a psych unit until he psychosis resolve .
I be give copy of a citation for simple assault and battery , then go to the police station several day later to find out what other paperwork be available on this incident .
I be give a copy of a different citation , but with the identical information from the one I would get the night of the incident .
the police report have the victim say she be `` choke to where she almost lose consciousness , strike in the face with a belt buckle and it have leave large mark , and that he would grab she breast and leave mark .
accord to the police report , this woman never report to the er for verification of the injury and no one else can verify exactly what happen to provoke this incident .
my roommate have no recollection of the time from the day before the incident happen until he wake up at the other hospital .
he be cite for simple assault and battery .
if there be no evidence , and that include the belt buckle , how can the county prosecute this case .
?
all of he belongings be return to I upon he discharge , with the exception of the belt buckle .
the police do not have it and the hospital do not know what happen to it .
also , I be look at both citation , I do not get to the hospital until 2:30 am , and the officer have the time of incident as be at 2:34 am .
do anyone besides I see a problem with any of this ?
what kind of recourse do my roommate have in all of this ?
thanks from Oklahoma John A. Weeks III Tue , 01 Feb 2005 18:16:16 -0500 Re : question regard simple assault & battery you need a attorney right away .
you be not go to be able to poke hole in this case with internet advice .
in addition , I be suggest raise the stake .
the hospital obviously know that you friend be have head problem , and they improperly treat he by not send he to a psych ward , which allow the situation to get worse until the point where he assault someone .
sue they for malpractice , and make the number big enough to get some serious attention .

North Korea have nuclear weapon .
the Independent of Clackamas County wed , 09 Feb 2005 23:32:07 -0800 North Korea have nuclear weapon .
the foreign minister of North Korea have state that North Korea have nuclear weapon and have officially with draw from the 6 nation talk on nuclear proliferation in east Asia .
the Foreign minister also indicate that North Korea will continue to develop long range missile capable of obliterate any target within the border of the United States .
accord to East Asia Intelligence source , North Korea have already prepositioned nuclear tip missile on freighter and fishing trawler that be sail under foreign flag of convenience , that be station off the west coast and east coast of the United States .
missile launch from these vessel be say to be able to hit 90 % percent of the major city with in 2 and one half minute from time of launch .
I do not know about the rest of you but I think that in the next few week I will be move supplies and equipment to my site in eastern Oregon .
of course you can do what you want but I do not trust the pot belly idiot Kim junk Ill any farther than I could throw he .

well here be the problem that I face and many should be worry about .
if North Korea have have nuclear weapon for a few year then they develop they during the Clinton Administration .
the Clinton Administration also allow Loral to sell Missile technology to China , who have be help Pakistan to build they missile .
that technology have undoubtably make it back to North Korea -lrb- Pakistan , Iran and North Korea be all work on the same set of missile blue print -rrb- .
so now we have North Korea with nuclear weapon and workable missile .
also since we miss the boat on North Korea and nuclear weapon how can we be sure that Iran do not have nuclear weapon ?
the simple and wisest action be to assume that they do have a small number and be work feverishly to build a bigger arsenal .
now the nut of the question should be , what if Iran give , sell , provide nuclear weapon to islamic extremist to smuggle into the United States and at 10 be on a Wednesday pop 2 or 3 in New York City , destroy Wall street , the large bank , the large insurance company , the large sock brokerage house and many other world wide financial institution .
at the same time 2 weapon go off in Washington DC and take out the President , the Vice President , 80 senator , and 350 congressman as well as the department of the treasury , Interior , Health and Welfare , Justice , Commerce and the Federal Court system .
and then just for yuck let assume that one go off at the Pentagon .
now what do we do ?
remember all you pension fund be now go .
all you investment be go .
all the bank record be go .
no more government payment for federal employee .
no more government payment for aid to school , environment , police , court , well fare , etc. .
the dollar be now worthless on the international market .
with a worthless dollar the amount of fuel available be not cut by 80 % .
no more cheap import of clothes , boot , appliance , computer stuff , communication equipment , generator , electric motor car , Trucks etc. .
massive unemployment as we be now in a service economy with nothing to service .
do the word TEOTWAWKI have any meaning .
oh I expect to thing to hang together for a few week as local , county , and state government try to hold thing together , but they will not .
with out fuel to move food stuff from the farm to food manufacture to local warehouse food stuff will dry up with in a few week or so .
with out fuel to move import stuff -lrb- most of what we buy these day -rrb- from the port of entry to local warehouse and local retailer shelf of item like building material , tool , and every thing else we buy the shelf will be empty in a month or so .
of course the above do not take into account that people drive by fear do not riot and loot every thing in site in the first week .
if the attack should happen in the winter , no natural gas from Canada to heat home , or fire steam drive electrical generator .
of course we could convert back to coal but it will take a couple of week to convert they to coal but then how do you get the coal from the mine to the power plant ???
with no Social Security or pension payment , aid to Dependent Children and other government payment , food stamp , -lrb- which be all check and voucher -rrb- , and there be no bank to cash they , -lrb- they get all wipe out in the New York financial destruction remember -rrb- no body will accept they .
no the situation do not look good from where I sit .
oh we can work on the assumption that the Mullahs of Iran will be rational , -lrb- but how rational be people who train and fund suicide bomber -rrb- and a rational Kim junk Ill -lrb- who let large number of he people starve to death every year so he can have nuclear weapon -rrb- kidnap japanese Citizens to teach English , kidnap movie star so he can have private performance etc. .
look at Kim Jung Ill behavior over the last decade or so any you will find that Hitler be a saint compare to Kim junk Ill. .
no it be go to be a scary time for the next decade or so and the neo-chamberlin -lrb- most of the leftist that most on this board -rrb- -lrb- you know prime minister chamberlin hold up he piece of paper contain a agreement from Herr Hitler with peace in we time -rrb- , be not go to do one thing to keep this country safe .

s Corp Profit distribution and bankrupcy .

my uncle declare bankruptcy in 2003 and he case close in June 2004 .
if I give he share in my corporation in Feb 2004 of my s Corporation make he 30 % shareholder , and I finally distribute profit this year , will the creditor attempt to that take money from he in 2005 ?
Thomas Healy Fri , 18 Feb 2005 06:09:54 GMT Re : S Corp Profit distribution and bankrupcy .
on 2/17/05 10:50 PM , in article 1108705852.360452.268...@f14g2 000cwb .
googlegroups.com , probably not .
but if he be require to list the share in bankruptcy filings , and do not , the answer may be different .
I think , though , that any transaction after the bankruptcy filing date be part of he new life .
-- Tom Healy , CPA Boulder , CO web : shyster1040 fri , 18 Feb 2005 08:32:13 -0500 Re : S Corp Profit distribution and bankrupcy .
be the trustee inform of the transfer of the share ?
since you give you uncle the share prior to he discharge , the share should have become asset available to the bankruptcy estate for the satisfaction of debt .
if the share transfer be report to the trustee and the trustee do nothing about they , then you may be ok ; however , if you fail to inform the trustee , then you uncle may be liable for hide asset , which would , at the minimum , invalidate he discharge .
even if the transfer do not invalidate the whole discharge , the distribution might be subject to forfeiture to pay creditor ' claim if you fail to inform the trustee of the share transfer .
you need to speak to a bankruptcy attorney pronto ; this be a bankruptcy matter , not a tax matter .
superprimen...@gmail.com 18 Feb 2005 10:49:15 -0800 Re : S Corp Profit distribution and bankrupcy .
the bankrupcy filing take place in 2003 , but it didnt clear until early 2004 and that be when i give he the share .
he have no share in 2003 .
shyster1040 fri , 18 Feb 2005 14:21:23 -0500 Re : S Corp Profit distribution and bankrupcy .
yes , but accord to the fact you first give , he have not yet receive the bankruptcy discharge when you give he the share .
I believe you have say that you give he the share in February 2004 but that the discharge do not come until June of 2004 .
that mean that he receive the share while he be still in bankruptcy , which mean that the share be potentially asset that the trustee could use to pay off creditor .
a bankruptcy case do not close until you get the discharge order , and until then everything that the debtor receive be fair game for the trustee .
if the trustee be inform of the share and do nothing about it , you be more likely than not ok , but if the trustee be not inform of the fact directly , then you may be in trouble .
if , however , you uncle receive the share after he obtain a order of discharge from the bankruptcy court , then as a general matter the creditor can not go after the share , unless they can prove that there be collusion between you and you uncle to hide he asset from they -lrb- e.g. , by put he asset in the corporation 's name and then wait until after the bankruptcy to transfer the share to he -rrb- .

watch Larry King last night about the BTK killer and something just seem off about the whole thing .
I do not understand -- be not print take , etc ?
they have witness and I feel they have a whole lot more stuff .
what about print , DNM take off of current envelope , etc. , he send ?
I ~ know ~ and realize how difficult it be to get these serial killer , but still .
a author plug he book on lk claim and with a good bit of blow that the investigation was/is as big as Kennedy 's .

a serial killer in Wichita , Kansas who kill at least 8 people in the '70 and '80 .
btk stand for bind , torture , and kill .
he send several letter to the police and the media during that time .
and now he be communicate with they again , send token from he victim .
or someone be play a big hoax .
I have wonder too , with all the forensic advance in the past 25 year why he have not be identify .
here be a link .
sue D. raylopez99 27 Feb 2005 12:54:03 -0800 Re : BTK why be it so difficult to get he ?
you do well to wonder why the BTK killer be not capture until yesterday .
the informal speculation be that the Wichita police department be not up to the task .
consider this : - one of the BTK killer 's victim live on the same street as the killer - the btk killer once call up a police dispatcher and tell she of the crime he just commit , and still they could not catch he - the BTK killer be a known nitpicker and nuissance .
this be actually a indicator in profile of serial killer and mastermind terrorist .
- the BTK killer be only find out when he daughter recognize certain trait and turn in she dna , which be a close match to the dna on file for she father .
like in the case of the Unibomber , if it be not for the foresight and charity of a relative , the BTK killer would still be loose .
I be once read how a criminal be be track in Washington , DC , and how he escape a police dragnet several time , once by take a taxi .
though there be very brave police , to a large extent the police have no incentive to capture a criminal , just to stay out of harm 's way and to collect fact after the fact .
the rich hire private security for a reason -- public security be often inadequate .

-lsb- tan -rsb- Parole Mark Erikson 8 Feb 2005 10:50:23 -0800 -lsb- tan -rsb- Parole this be just a point of interest , I be not go to jail , and most certainly not in America - and my interest lie in the american jail system .
I have browse around the internet and can not find the information I be after .
what be the deal with parole ?
if you get out on parole , what happen then , and how long do it last ?
-lrb- and , specifically , who take you home once you get out of jail , or do you just get turf out and expect to check in with you parole officer the next day ? -rrb-
.
and , again fairly specifically -lrb- and I realise this be state specific , but I be kinda look for a general answer here -rrb- : if a eighteen year old get catch sell marijuana to 12-14 year old , and get put away for , say , three year , be this the sort of deal where he be likely to get parole , or just do the time and leave again ?
- Mark Erikson Vinny R. Tue , 08 Feb 2005 14:22:50 -0500 Re : -lsb- tan -rsb- Parole get out on parole be usually a reward for good behavior while serve time .
so you be basically free , with the expectation that you will not leave the state -lrb- assume you have be jail by the state gov ` t -rrb- and you have to check in with you parole officer on a regular basis -lrb- I think they give you a schedule -rrb- .
I * believe * you be also expect to get a job , housing , etc. and report this also .
in some case you may be refer to a specific ` halfway ' house for reintroduction into society , and provide with a simple job .
as for how long it last , I would say that it last for the rest of you sentence , but I be not sure about that .
also , you can call someone to come pick you up when you leave , or call a taxi I guess .
not just state-specific , judge -lrb- jury -rrb- - specific and case-specific .
for some reason , I can not recall if sell drug to minor qualify as a jury trial or what .
but these decision be entirely up to the judge/jury , and the decision be usually make in regard to the character of the defendant .
- Vinny R. Kate Nepveu wed , 09 Feb 2005 01:11:36 GMT Re : -lsb- tan -rsb- Parole this be all base on my experience in New York .
you have to provide a plan residence when you be consider for parole , usually a relative or program of some kind .
it last as long as the rest of you sentence last .
you can go back to prison for violate the condition of you parole , for a period of time up until you sentence run out .
Parole be not a right and its grant be discretionary .

OT : Republican election standard gould0...@aol.com 30 Jan 2005 10:06:08 -0800 OT : Republican election standard here on the left edge of the country , we have a unique perspective on election standard .
in Iraq , a election take place in which one of the three major force vie for control of the country opt out .
a few people will turn out and elect somebody .
it be hail as the greatest triumph of democracy since the defeat of Imperial Japan .
in Washington State , we governor 's race may be undecided for month to come .
follow the election and recount process exactly as outline in we state constitution , the democratic candidate win by a margin of less than 200 vote .
with roughly three million vote cast in the race , the margin of victory be a few ten thousand of one percent or some such microscopic amount .
for all intent and purpose it be a tie - but somebody have to end up with a few more vote and this time around it be the demo .
the same group of people who have say `` even if some region be too unsafe for people to go to the poll and even if large portion of the population will not recognize the legitimacy of the outcome , some election be better than no election , and it be a great day for democracy ! ''
... be sue to overthrow the result of the governor 's election be Washington State because there be some `` error '' in the process .
-lrb- they holler `` fraud '' until they get to court , but unable to find any evidence with which to substantiate that charge they have back down to `` error '' . -rrb-
so the standard be : any old process halfway resemble a election be just diddly dandy in Iraq , but we will not accept the result of a free and fair election in Washington State because there may have be a human error rate of 0.0000001 percent .
in Washington State , the election have to be not only free and fair , but also `` perfect '' .
-lrb- of course , the Republicans would have think the WA State election * be * perfect , have they candidate hold the same 100 and some vote margin when all the smoke finally clear -rrb- .
funny how the standard change , and so easily , depend on agenda .
Bert Robbins Sun , 30 Jan 2005 13:52:34 -0500 Re : Republican election standard we have see we state 's standard .
keep recount the vote until you get the result you want and if you need to go `` find '' some more vote in a warehouse , in a box , hide behind some other box .
this be too funny .
the one that be `` opt '' out be in one of three protect class within Iraq .
the protected class be Kurd 's , Sunni 's and woman .
only vote that end in a tie be where both side have the exact same number of vote .
this do not happen in Washington State .
it take multiple recount before the vote tabulation be determine to be credible by the Democrats .
be not it King County that have `` count '' more vote than register voter .
please explain how this happen .
it seem that the evidence of irregularity in the voting process be extremely apparent .
yes , it be funny be not it ?

think about this objectively -lrb- forget the US be involve -rrb- , if a foreign country invade another and set up election , would not a reasonable person question the validity of the election result ?
let 's assign some name .
say it be 1942 , and the german occupier in Holland have set up election with dutch candidate .
well , not really candidate , but political party -- you will be tell who the candidate be later .
would you say the result be valid ?
even if you , John H , believe the US hold impartial election in Iraq , do not you think the rest of the world will find the result invalid , or least suspect ?

not even Chris -lrb- Kerry 's my man -rrb- Mathews could find any real fault with the outcome .
we soldier weren ' e even close to the poll .
hell , they could not even see the poll in most place , so the intimidation bullshit be just that .
even Brian Williams , when question by Chris , have to admit that he see nothing to show US intimidation .
-lrb- you could tell it be kill Brian to have to admit that ! -rrb-
of course , you probably know better since you be there , right ?
here , go read something from people who be there : if you look closely , you will even find some negative to gloat over .
Bert Robbins Sun , 30 Jan 2005 20:26:26 -0500 Re : OT : Republican election standard you have to start somewhere and this election be to get a legislative body to write a constitution for Iraq .

turn out the August 2003 crisis be not a crisis Sam Sloan Thu , 16 Dec 2004 15:47:26 GMT turn out the August 2003 crisis be not a crisis turn out the August 2003 crisis be not a crisis everyone have hear the story : Beatriz Marinello be elect USCF President on August 11 , 2003 in Los Angeles .
immediately after she take office , she find out that the USCF have no money in the bank , zero .
the uscf do not even have the money to pay the guarantee prize at the just conclude US open in Los Angeles .
therefore , on August 20 , 2003 , bravely Beatriz walk into the USCF office in New Windsor and immediately fire 17 staff member .
John McCrary resign from the board as a result .
of course , it be just a pure coincidence that the 17 people beatriz fire be the people she have grow to dislike during the year that she work for the USCF in 1999-2000 .
it take six week before the USCF pay the guarantee prize the prize winner have win at the US Open .
I have just find out something that insider have know for a long time .
the uscf do not have zero money in the bank .
it have $ 85,000 in another bank account that nobody know about .
this be not due to any malfeasance .
the office accountant for the USCF have set up a separate bank account and have put the entry fee from the US open into that account .
nobody know about that separate bank account , except for the accountant herself .
when this be discover , the accountant explain that she be plan to keep the money in that account until the tournament be close out .
perhaps the accountant be follow a procedure follow by the USCF for scholastic tournament .
at scholastic tournament , no cash prize be pay .
however , in adult tournament , the player expect to receive they prize , and to receive they immediately .
for this act of stupidity which have cause a grave crisis in the USCF , the accountant be immediately fire .
have the existence of this $ 85,000 in a secret bank account be know , it would not have be necessary to fire those 17 people right away .
perhaps in the long run it be a good thing to fire they , but it might not have be a good idea to fire they all abruptly , in the same day .

he be ask to wait until after the LA meeting be over before resign .
right , we shoulda piss another 85,000 away before we stop the red ink .
Parrthenon 17 Dec 2004 02:29:13 GMT Re : turn out the August 2003 crisis be not a crisis Frank Niro thanks Sam Sloan in this message to the FIDE newsgroup : Thu , 16 Dec 2004 21:06:29 EST Frank Niro comment on the Aug 2003 so-called crisis yes , Sam , you be correct .
and I know about it also .
I also know about the $ 100,000 + of audit adjustment -lrb- and non-adjustment -rrb- for inventory , unbilled advertising , newsstand sale , tournament revenue , pension & health insurance over-accrual , multus year membership revenue , etc. etc. that I be too sick to argue with Linda and the auditor about .
I know that they would get correct as a matter of course during fiscal 2004 result in understatement of 2003 income and overstatement of 2004 .
and , of course , that be what happen .
I just have no idea that the new Board would see it as leverage to seize power and pummel the office staff .
not only be there adequate cash put aside , we have approval for a equity loan on the building to bridge the move .
but I do not want to pay the $ 10,000 point and interest unless and until it be absolutely necessary .
we also have a buyer for the building at a prize much higher than it be eventually sell for and a commitment for 4 % bank financing in Crossville .
Staff reduction be clearly in the work pend system change that would be facilitate by any move , Miami , PBG , Crossville or elsewhere .
to make the staff cut without the system change be absurd and probably the reason for McCrary & Camaratta 's departure .
when I offer to attend the Board meeting in October 2003 to explain and clarify all this , I be tell I be not welcome .
I sit in New Windsor all weekend wait for a phone call so I could answer EB question and shed light on the situation .
it be no coincidence that the employee let go include substantially all those who have offer to transfer to Crossville , include -lrb- remarkably -rrb- the employee of the year !
you can read all this in my book come out next summer .
thanks for see the truth for a change .

ethical and legal issue in hire Marinello Petrel Sat , 18 Dec 2004 02:11:28 GMT Ethical and legal issue in hire Marinello it have be suggest that there be , or be at one time , some sort of delegate ' motion which establish a minimum period between the time someone could leave the EB and the time someone could be hire by the USCF .
I do not know if this be so , and I really think it be sort of irrelevant .
it be irrelevant because the REAL question be whether a active board member can , while on the board , arrange to be give money by the USCF .
of course it be in the bylaw that a active board member can not be give money by the uscf while on the board .
it ought to be pretty obvious that it would be entirely contrary to the spirit of this for a active board member to be money after leave the board .
suppose , for example , there be to be a proposal to the effect that each EB member would be give $ 10,000 upon the expiration of his/her term .
clearly this would be a transparent attempt to evade the bylaw and would fail .
if the board can not vote to give themselves present money , they can not vote to give themselves future money either .
furthermore , it do not matter whether this arrangement be embody in a EB vote or not , or whether the discussion of the proposal take place in a formal EB meeting or not .
a board member , while on the board , be suppose to be represent the interest of the USCF , not feather his/her nest , in the present or in the future .
if a board member make such arrangement , it be clearly a ethic violation , clearly a violation of the bylaw , possibly endanger we tax-exempt status , and be possibly a violation of law as well .
the purpose of have a `` time limit '' would be as a mechanism to ensure compliance with the above principle ; that be , you would have a time limit because it would reduce the likelihood that someone would be tempt to violate the above prohibition ; it would give the voter time to elect a new EB that would consider the issue objectively .
of course , it be possible that someone could leave the board - without - ever have discuss be compensate by the board in the future , and that then the remain member could , for good reason , hire that person .
it would create question among the suspicious - and avoid this appearance of wrongdoing would be another good reason for a time limit - but it would not automatically be a ethic or bylaw violation .
but this be neither here nor there , because the fact that Randy Bauer be already talk about Beatriz Marinello as the USCF 's new `` move coordinator '' , whatever that involve , and whether or not it mean that she would be the de facto interim ED , mean that at some level and in some form these discussion HAVE already take place , while Marinello be serve as President .
I mean , it be conceivable that the other six have all get together in Marinello 's absence and draft she , but it also seem pretty clear that she have agree to do it , and , if all the rumor be true and she step down , it will be so that she can take on these new responsibility .
so the ` time limit ' issue do not even come up .
we pretty much know that Marinello , while on the board , have arrange to get future money from the USCF .
so we already have a problem .
if this be not a problem , I wish someone would explain to I why not .
now , Stan B. argue that Marinello 's service be in fact indispensible as move coordinator , and that ethic standard be not a suicide pact , so that since we absolutely need she the EB have the right to go ahead and retain she .
I agree with the principle .
but I think that to make this argument work the EB would have to produce some evidence that Marinello really be indispensible for this task .
this would have to include evidence that the EB have consider all the alternative , include : - delegate the whole thing to the Interim ED , which would be the normal practice in normal organization with a ed - ask the Interim ED to designate someone from the New Windsor staff to act as move coordinator - ask the Interim ED to hire some other consultant with experience in office relocation to manage the job -lrb- there be such people -rrb- - conduct some kind of actual search for candidate for the position during the last two month since the move be decide upon if they do consider alternative , it would also have to include evidence that Marinello have much more experience at relocate office than other people , or be willing to do the job cheaper -lrb- although this would not constitute be `` indispensible '' in my view -rrb- .
if , however , they just look around the room and say `` who be go to manage this ? ''
and someone say , `` Beatriz , how about you ? ''
, this do not constitute proof that she service be indispensible , and thus it would not interfere with my belief that there have be a ethic violation and a bylaw violation .
one very bad argument that be make by Kevin Bachler , which to be fair be surround by arguably better one , be that since this board be elect , we should let they do as they please .
which be to say that there might as well not be bylaw , ethic standard , law , etc. , since a elect board be not bind by any of they .
I think this idea should be reject .
another argument , which be better but still disturbing , be that , yes , this be a ethic violation , and maybe worse , but it would only hurt the uscf to talk about it , and that only troublemaker like Sam Sloan , Larry Parr , and , I suppose , I , would talk about it , since do so will obstruct the federation 's plan , cause we to pay legal expense , run the risk of we be stick without any office space at all , cause people not to loan we money , and so forth .
so we should all ignore this because it be realistic to do so .
I be not entirely unsympathetic to this , actually .
but frankly I think that a whole lot of the problem the USCF have have over the year have have to do with well-intentioned people keep secret because bring they out in the open would harm the USCF , and as a result we have awful habit which hurt the USCF even worse .
but if we be go to talk about realism , here be another realistic concern : I predict that , if , in fact , the rumor about the agenda for the Florida meeting prove true , and Marinello resign as President and be hire as move coordinator , the immediate result of this be that Sam Sloan will file another lawsuit -lrb- or amend he current complaint -rrb- charge the USCF EB member with self-dealing , violation of the USCF 's own bylaw , and every other thing , report we to the IRS , and demand that all USCF money which might be use to pay Marinello be freeze .
this be not base on any communication from Sam , direct or indirect .
it be just logical .
if he be willing to file a lawsuit on the basis of New York non-profit organization law , which might or might not be applicable to the USCF , why would not he file a lawsuit on the basis of the USCF 's violation of its own bylaw , which unquestionably be applicable to the USCF ?
I write a few day ago quote my own employer association 's attorney , who say that court mostly let association do what they want unless they violate they own bylaw .
it be irritating enough to get sue by Sam Sloan ; imagine how irritating it would be to get sue by Sam Sloan and BEATEN by Sam Sloan because you have do something so egregious that a court be force to agree with he .

OT : new stuff on US election fraud Chris Rockcliffe wed , 29 Dec 2004 00:28:16 +0000 OT : new stuff on US election fraud US election fraud : whisper grow to a roar now a person state he be republican insider be blow the whistle , indicate that the fraud be much greater than just a handful of vote in Ohio and Florida .
the Ukraine have nothing on it .
accord to this person Kerry win decisively not only in Ohio and Florida but also in a number of other States and in the overall popular vote .
he say he know how the fraud be work .
could this be why so many in the Bush gang have be jump ship ?
how will it affect the two sniveller John Howard and Tony Blair if the whistleblowing become as insistent as it do over the far , far lesser offence of Richard Nixon or the personal indiscretion of Bill Clinton ?
the article be at .
thanks to Tony Troughton-Smith for post this article on the StopMAI WA newsgroup .
see for a statement by Michel Chussudovsky about the host site .
Dion Giles Western Australia Voter Fraud in Florida and Ohio : Kerry Won the election by at least 1,7 Million vote by Brad Menfil The url of this article be : ---------- Brad Menfil be not my real name .
I work for the rnc -lsb- Republican National Committee -rsb- .
I fear reprisal if I be find out .
the truth about this election be this : Florida and Ohio have to go for Bush in order for he to `` win '' the election .
in reality he lose both state .
in fact , he do not even win the popular vote .
he lose the national popular vote by at least 1,750,000 .
this show you the scale of the fraud .
the exit poll be not wrong .
Kerry be the clear winner , but victory be snatch from he .
Florida first .
the 200,000 + margin of victory for Bush make this state uncontestable .
everybody assume that even with some fraud , Kerry could never have make up the difference in a recount .
but Kerry actually win by about 750,000 vote .
the number be change by a computer program -lrb- in both electronic and scan-tron voting system -rrb- call `` KerryLite . ''
`` KerryLite '' of course be not actual name of the program .
the actual name be 11-5-18-18 etc. .
for additional encryption , the number be jumble but I be not sure in which order .
the number replace the letter of the alphabet .
for example , k be the eleventh letter of the alphabet .
so the if-then statement go something like this : `` if total true Kerry -rrb- total true Bush , Bush x 1.04 x -lrb- .04 be a random number -rrb- -lrb- total true Kerry -rrb- , total true Bush '' .
the second part of the equation take the total number of vote cast and subtract the new Bush total , subtract the third party total and leave the rest for Kerry .
sometimes the program would also reduce third party vote and award they to Bush .
and even where Bush legitimately win , he be still award additional vote .
the big democratic county -lrb- Broward for example -rrb- go to Kerry because it have to appear that everything be on the up and up .
it be interesting to see this unfold .
do anybody wonder why the Republican county be mostly count after the democratic county ?
you should wonder , and also know that this be no accident .
the Bush team have to make up the vote as the night go on .
in Ohio , computer voting fraud , vote toss and voter suppression be the main method .
vote toss be simply the removal of Kerry vote and some third party vote .
in some area , the Bush vs. Kerry vote be absurd .
nine to one , eight to two .
Voter suppression take the form of make voter stand in four hour long line .
this of course take place in democratic area .
the simplest thing to do be to have too few voting machine .
sometimes that be all it take .
people eventually lose patience and leave without cast a vote .
in other state such as New Mexico , Nevada , Iowa and New Hampshire , Kerry 's lead evaporate very quickly once the poll be shut down .
Kerry only win New Hampshire , but barely .
as it turn out , the lead be 6 % for Kerry in that state and not enough fraudulent activity take place to flip the state to Bush .
so this will all come out and be know to everyone .
nothing this massive can be keep a secret .
you be already begin to see these `` irregularity '' and the whisper will become a roar .

Bush have no shame -lrb- npc -rrb- bomagosh yndit 15 Dec 2004 12:54:29 -0800 Bush have no shame -lrb- npc -rrb- I really could not believe what I be watch while Bush put medal on talent , Franks and Bremer .
talent be in charge of the CIA when two of the most costly intelligence failure in american history happen -- not recognize the Sept. 11 plot , and wrongly claim that Saddam have a stockpile of wmd .
even people who mindlessly defend Bush 's policy , like wjb67 , do not want to take responsibility for talent -- they point out that he be originally appoint by Clinton .
Franks be in charge of the operation that be suppose to quickly go in , take over Iraq , and then start move we troops out rapidly -- at this point I think we be go to see we troops over there at least through the end of the decade .
and Bremer decide to destroy the exist iraqi army , leave it up to we and new recruit to try to impose order .
this be just one more of those wierd , through-the-looking-glass moment when Bush be try to make something that at the very least have to be see as troubling , and that I consider a unmitigated failure , into a success .
rpmoria...@aol.com 15 Dec 2004 13:01:46 -0800 Re : Bush have no shame -lrb- npc -rrb- troubling indeed ... I will say go a little easier on franks-not that he deserve a medal - than the other two idiot though .
he be not give very much to work with -- Cheney and Rummy be the one to blame for the screw up war plans-of course I be sure they will get they medal too .
Bush be one of those guy that just see how he want to see , and that be a terrible trait for a leader to have -- rose-colored something something I beleive it be call .
now THIS be a argument against Bush I can throw my arm around !

they be just try to produce energy , as we have several nuclear power plant .
and all the demand to Syria ... this all seem so predictable .
and if you be wonder , this be the link I get that from ... I like this quote the best , but I be sure it mean nothing to we -lrb- we be the US 's power that be -rrb- ... `` the iranian nation be not look for war , violence and confrontation , '' Khatami say .

Moondog Thu , 17 Feb 2005 19:52:32 -0600 Re : War with Iran please .
this be a cop-out response .
the reason we be so worried be because we be on a higher level than 90 % of the world because we have nucler weapon .
if country we do not like start develop nuclear weapons-grade material it make we nervous .
although so far , iran have show that they be * not * produce weapons-grade material and be in fact use they nuclear power for just that , accord to the IAEA .
but when you have a sit president who have a infatuation with provoke other country into a war , you can bet that he will try everything he can to try to prove he case against iran .
maybe because oil be a much bigger pollute source of energy than nuclear ?
or maybe because it be more cost effective for they to use nuclear than any other method ?
why should they run they energy supply off of one of they backbone industry when oil be worth more to they on the open market ?

Moondog Fri , 18 Feb 2005 01:30:55 -0600 Re : War with Iran it be not a question of whether i believe iran be tell the truth .
the question be ask : why be the US scared of iran , and you response be `` because they be lie '' .
this be a cop-out because you be not really prove anything , you be just make accusation without proof .
ok , they make a very very small amount of a material that could maybe be use in a weapon if they have more of it possibly .
but the fact be that iran be cooperate with most of the international community on this issue , whether you believe they or not .
this be about nuclear proliferation , not iraq 's insurgency .
i think that if they have proof of iran 's assistance to iraqi insurgent that it can be deal with later , once iraq be secure and able to handle its own affair .
for now , we be talk about the iranian nuclear program , not iraq .

we alliance to they be support people that want to have a free democratically elect gov ` t. finish the statement : then we will refer they to the security council .
what exactly be wrong with that ?
that be the type of diplomatic solution that all of the anti-war people want for iraq .
of course a whole bunch of resolution do nothing in iraq , but who know , maybe this time they will work .
personally , base on the aggressive stance they have take and the way they be help the insurgency in iraq , i tend to not believe they when they say that they be not look for a confrontation .
there be one Carousel organization again rapid T. Rabbit 17 Feb 2005 17:19:51 -0800 there be one Carousel organization again I just receive the latest issue of Merry-Go-Roundup , the quarterly publication of the National Carousel Association .
in it be a blurb report that the american Carousel Society have recently disband .
some of you may be wonder why there be two carousel organization in the first place .
the National Carousel Association be found in the early 1970 's by a group of art historian and collector , include Frederick Fried , author of the 1964 book `` a pictorial history of the Carousel '' that single-handedly give the classic hand-carved wooden carousel the respect and appreciation it deserve .
other founder include Charlotte Dinger , who be already a major collector of carousel artwork at the time .
the purpose of the NCA be `` to promote conservation , appreciation , knowledge and enjoyment of the art of the classic wooden carousel and especially the preservation of complete wooden carousel . ''
the organization attract a wide range of member , include carousel enthusiast , owners/operators , theme and amusement park , museum , library , those in the entertainment/recreation industry , art collector and even auction house , among other .
it be the presence of these last two name group that would eventually stir up controversy .
thanks in large part to the NCA , the art of the carousel be receive a lot of public attention and appreciation that it have not enjoy before .
however , this new and brighter spotlight on these antique ride also have the unfortunate effect of enhance the collectibility and monetary value of operational carousel .
they have become worth more money dead -lrb- i.e. in piece -rrb- than alive -lrb- i.e. function -rrb- .
as such , during the 1980 's many beautiful and unique wooden carousel would be break up at the auction block , as owner rush to cash in on the antique marketplace .
the liability insurance crisis further aggravate the situation , as amusement park operator seek to cut they loss , while at the same time liquidate underperform carousel to raise capital for the purchase of newer and more profitable -lrb- thrill -rrb- ride .
some collector of carousel art and auction house be accuse of use they NCA affiliation to gain information about vintage carousel that they could target for breakup to they own personal profit , a practice certainly contrary to the state goal of the organization .
the increase rift between the `` preservationist '' and `` collector '' would eventually boil over into a internal political struggle that cause many in the collector faction of the NCA to walk out of the group , include founder such as Charlotte Dinger and other .
the preservationist would choose to remain with the NCA , include Fred Fried .
at this time in the late 1970 's , carousel artwork collector and printer Marge Swenson be the editor of the NCA 's Merry-Go-Roundup publication .
the political struggle that occur within the nca result in two slate of officer be present for approval to the membership , something that be not suppose to happen .
a thicker-than-usual issue of the Roundup would be fill with accusation from both faction in the group each accuse the other of improper behavior .
Swenson herself would also leave the NCA .
not much later , she begin publish she own magazine call `` Carousel Art '' , which be essentially a scholarly photo album depict different carver and style each month .
meanwhile , those collector who leave the National Carousel Association band together to form the american Carousel Society -lrb- ACS -rrb- , whose state aim of carousel preservation also recognize collector as a positive asset towards that goal .
for the next couple of decade , the two carousel organization would co-exist , each attract its share of member .
some would actually join both group , and even attend both of they annual convention .
during the mid-1980 's Walter Louck would begin publish `` the Carousel Trader '' , later rename `` the Carousel News & Trader '' .
this monthly magazine would cover all angle and side of the story of the carousel and be well receive by all carousel enthusiast .
about a decade later , Carousel Art would suddenly cease publication .
the NCA would continue to issue the Roundup to its member .
the mid to late 1990 's see the passing of NCA founder Fred Fried , and also that of Charlotte Dinger , both who represent the two opposite point of view in the carousel preservation debate .
coincidentally and amazingly , the art of building hand-carved carousel -lrb- and even bandorgan -rrb- have be revive , with firm such as Carousel Works and Carousel Magic again build the popular ride in classic design .
this development seem to have greatly alleviate the antique marketplace pressure that have doom so many legacy wooden carousel over the past several decade .
the turn of the new millenium actually witnessese a thaw in the relationship between the National Carousel Association and American Carousel Society , as newer and younger leadership take over from the founding generation .
the two group decide that the bickering between they be wasteful , conterproductive and pointless .
there be talk of a -lrb- re -rrb- merger but the regulation govern non-profit prevent that .
however , it be decide that NCA and ACS hold joint convention to save on cost to both the club and the member .
just within the past couple of month though , the american Carousel Society have determine that they do not have the funding to continue with the operation of they organization and officially cease to exist .
so now , once again there be a single nationwide organization to join if you love carousel !

Club Sports policy at school ; specifically travel restriction d-c...@northwestern.edu 9 Feb 2005 19:02:57 -0800 Club Sports policy at school ; specifically travel restriction hello everyone - I be attempt to learn more information about the policy of various athletic department at school , specifically with regard to ultimate team .
at Northwestern , the Men 's Ultimate team fall under the Club Sports department which fall into a dark , barely light corner of the Athletic Department .
there be some restriction on what we can and can not do .
the one that I be most interested in compare to similar policy at other school concern we ability to travel .
at Northwestern , we be allow to either rent school van for no charge or take we own vehicle to tournament within 300 mile of Evanston , il .
also , we be allow to fly , take a bus , or take Amtrak to any tournament we want , no matter how far away it be .
we be allow to compete under the Northwestern name if we take any of these option .
however , it often occur that we want to go to a tournament farther than 300 mile without fly .
-lrb- for example , Regionals be often slightly farther than 300 mile , yet a reasonable drive . -rrb-
if we choose to do so , it be understand that we be not officially compete under the Northwestern name - we be just a group of people play ultimate at a tournament and not involve the university in any way .
do any of you other college player face similar restriction in you travel ?
what be you school ' policy ?
I be interested in both the response of player at public and private school .
feel free to email I if you do want to post to the forum .
thanks for you help .

that mean bid , hotel , transportation , jersey -lrb- I do have to mention , we jersey this year be hot -rrb- .
that doesnt go very far , and that a hard cap on anything related to competition for all competetive club sport team .
next year we will be budgeting we jersey as `` practice jersey '' however , so we hope they will be pay for .
the point be , $ 2k get we to about a tournament and a half use University transportation .
I dont know about play officially under the university 's name , or why that matter really .
as long as the registrar sign off on the roster for the UPA , doesnt the importance of University affiliation become moot ?

we pay for we flights/rental car out of pocket .
I be specifically interested in the `` drive radius '' , as we call it .
what be you school 's ?
it matter for liability question .
Cesa cots...@yahoo.com 9 Feb 2005 19:52:48 -0800 Re : Club Sports policy at school ; specifically travel restriction at SUNY Albany in NY , about as state school as you can get , we get about 500 less than what you be talk about at Pitt .
we school do not really care what we do at tournament or how far away we be .
we take we own car to every tournament , even one down in Maryland .
the money we get from we student association have to pay for jersey , be suppose to help we with tournament , etc. .
every tournament we team go to , we each pay 10-20 buck out of pocket .
if you be a ultimate frisbee team and sleep in hotel ... consider yourself as spoil as a ultimate team get in my opinion .
you get ta learn how to save money .
most tournament will house you if you ask and explain you situation .
if we can not get housing , we camp out somewhere .
at Binghamton this year we throw up a tent on the high jump mat -lrb- which I must say be very comfortable -rrb- .
regional 2 year ago , we team and about 7 other could not afford housing at Princeton so we camp way way out back on the field and hang out all night .
for you northwestern guy , you really need to get in touch with someone at you school that will listen .
we school do not like we for a long time , but we behave ourselves , and very respectfully approach various people , work we way up the ladder , about change some policy .
Start off low , and work you way up .
explain to they that if you be drive you own car , you should be able to go wherever you want , and even throw in there if for any reason you bring shame to the university , you will go right back to the old policy no question ask .
how often do you go to a tournament and whatever happen there get back to administration ?
pretty much never so you safe with that offer .
another thing we do be have a lot of fundraiser on campus , enter banner contest for sport event , etc. .
once the school see that unlike a lot of club , we be bust we ass to fundraise and get involve with school activity , they whole attitude towards we change .
sell disc , sell pint glass , then go to someone , more than one person , and show they what kind of effort you be put in .
a lot of school official do not understand how structured ultimate actually be .
go in and explain to they about Regionals not just be some little `` get together '' but actually be a championship series .
Hope my rambling give you some idea that might work ~ squirrel PS CLIPBOARD now , SEAN for the future !!!!!!!!!!!

Howie Wed , 16 Feb 2005 19:22:33 -0500 Re : renewal of marriage vow on carnival cruise my wife and I be guest at a wedding on the Carnival Legend on New year Eve 2003 .
all the guest be folk who have meet the bride and groom -lrb- a attractive young couple who be sailing alone -rrb- virtually on cruisecritic .
the wedding take place in the afternoon , before the ship set sail .
thus , the couple be actual marry by a justice of the peace in the state of Florida .
it be a great way to begin a cruise .
although I be not certain of this , I assume that renew you vow could actually be do while the ship be at sea , because it would not involve any legal issue .

I do not know the detail , but on my last cruise there be a large wedding go on .
the bride be all deck out in she long gown and veil , groom in tux and the other wedding party all dress to the nines !
they have one of the larger lounge close off for a private reception .
I do not think it be allow any more , but 30 minute until sail a announcement be make that all NON CRUISE guest must make they way to disembark the ship prior to sailing .
I have never hear that announcement before so I assume that it be for the people attend the wedding on board ?
this be the largest wedding gathering I have ever see on board ... maybe someone have connection ???
the bride be still visible later into the evening still wear she wedding gown on the Lido deck !

Carnival Corp - shareholder discount on Princess StephenM Tue , 22 Feb 2005 08:13:13 GMT Carnival Corp - shareholder discount on Princess I be take a 7 day cruise with Princess in March and apply for my $ 100 Carnival Corp. .
shareholder onboard credit .
turn out that my travel Agent have a ` group ' cruise on this ship and my $ 50/pp credit due to the ` group ' cruise make I ineligible for the shareholder credit .
this really make a mockery of the shareholder credit as almost every cruise have some sort of small credit attach .
$ 100 will not break the bank or make the cruise less enjoyable , nor will I stop be a shareholder , but I do find this sort of thing irritating .
Stephen George Leppla Tue , 22 Feb 2005 08:04:07 -0500 Re : Carnival Corp - shareholder discount on Princess this be incorrect .
have you TA get in touch with Rebecca Faroy at Carnival Corp 's Investor 's Relations department .
it seem that some Princess people be not fully aware of the correct policy .
the shareholder credit do apply to group booking .

Bob Tue , 22 Feb 2005 08:33:03 -0800 Re : Carnival Corp - shareholder discount on Princess you can get the larger of the shipboard credit .
until recently you could combine the stockholder credit with the credit for book on board , but not with those from you agent .
the most recent Carnival report under shareholder Benefit say , `` not combinable with any other shipboard offer '' .
therefore I recently sell my stock .

I believe that clause actually refer to promo cruise etc. and not to discount , or shipboard credit offer by you TA .
I have double up on shareholder credit on both Carnival Corp. cruise and rcl cruise .
maybe you need a different travel agent .

post-trip report - London ohaya sit , 01 Jan 2005 18:00:00 -0500 post-trip report - London Hi All , we * just * get back into Washington last evening , after we brief 5-day trip to London .
thanks for all of the response to my earlier inquiry , I be happy to report that everything go pretty well , but both my wife and I be pretty beat/tired .
we get into Heathrow on Monday morning .
at the airport , I get some cash from the Barclays ATM just outside the arrival area , as many have suggest .
FYI , I just check my bank account , and we get charge a $ 2.00 fee and the exchange rate be around $ 1.92 / GPB .
after that , we take the underground into London .
Zone 1-6 all-day pass cost 5.40 gbp each .
that be pretty easy ... the most difficult part be find the hotel once we finally get off at the final tube station .
the hotel be nice enough to let we check in , even though we be a bit early -lrb- we get in around 12:30 , normal check-in time be 14:30 -rrb- , which we be really grateful for , after drag we bag for a couple of hour .
after settle into the hotel room -lrb- my wife be a `` unpack everything-and-stow it '' type of person -rrb- , we go to do a little explore .
be that this be a holiday , a lot of the local place be close -lrb- include restaurant in the hotel -rrb- , but we find a kind of combo newsagent/foodstore nearby , and we pick up a 5 gbp call card -lrb- for call home -rrb- and some drink -lrb- 1.59 gpb for ~ 2 liter Pepsi light , .98 gbp for a ~ 2 liter water -rrb- .
it take we awhile , but we find a restaurant/pub -lrb- White swan -rrb- that be open .
it seem like a kind of local place , and the woman that be run the place be very nice .
when we walk in , we stand around wait to be seat :-rrb- , and she say `` this be a pub , sit anywhere , and order at the bar '' .
I gather -lrb- from that and a few visit at other pub -rrb- that that be the norm .
anyway , we have a nice late lunch : fish and chip -lrb- with `` mashed pea '' -rrb- for I , and a beef pie for my wife .
FYI , this be probably the most reasonable meal that we have during we whole visit .
that night , we walk around the area around the Victoria underground station , because we be suppose to meet up with a tour the next morning .
while there , we find a local Sainsbury -lrb- kind of a small supermarket -rrb- about 2 block from the underground station , and stock up on some cheese , milk , and croissant .
price here be a bit cheaper than the local foodstore , and during we trip , I make several trip here :-rrb- .
we be not sure what we want to eat for dinner , so we just wander around a bit , and finally end up at a `` steakhouse '' near the station ... big mistake .
the food , service , and price be very bad ... I guess we should have figure that one out when 3 other party walk out after be seat , but unfortunately , we have already order , so we feel kind of obligate to finish .
I do not know if this be the case with all `` steakhouse '' , but we stay away from they all after that :-lrb- .
we take a all day bus tour -lrb- Evan Evans -rrb- , include the London Eye .
take the underground to Victoria , and walk to the Victoria coach Station -lrb- it be NOT the same :-rrb- -rrb- .
I think that the tour be a pretty good way to get introduce to part of the city .
we get to see a lot in a short time , include extend tour of Westminster -lrb- feel kind of strange walk over dead people -rrb- and the tower of London -lrb- neat ! -rrb-
.
this tour include lunch at another pub near Trafalgar Square -lrb- more beef pie for we -rrb- , and the tour guide be very good , and kind of funny .
it be kind of like travel with a `` grand dad '' and he do he best to keep we all together .
at the end of the land tour , we go on ride on one of the Thames cruise boat -lrb- warning , it be freeze on the top deck ... -rrb- , and then a ride on the London Eye .
all in all , recommend , but afterwards , both my wife and I agree that a `` all-day '' tour be too exhausting -lrb- even on a bus tour , you have to do a lot of walk especially get to the change of the Guards and at the London Tower -rrb- , and we probably would have prefer break it into 2 1/2 day tour .
we also take one of the hop-on/hop-off bus tour -lrb- the `` original '' -rrb- on one of the other day , as we think it be the easiest way to get around to the place that we want to re-visit .
a couple of comment : take the one with the live guide if you can , as it be much more interesting than the one with the record commentary -lrb- you can ask question -rrb- .
also , if you want to get a seat on the top deck , take one of the earlier bus , as at least when we be there , it be impossible to get a seat on top later in the day , and you can not see much from the lower -lrb- enclose -rrb- deck -lrb- but it be much warmer :-rrb- ! -rrb-
.
we have be buy the 2-zone all-day tube pass -lrb- 4.20 gbp each -rrb- everyday , just to get around to dinner and shopping on we own , but by the time this be all over , my wife do not feel like take the underground back to Heathrow , so we have ask the hotel conceierge to make a reservation on a airport bus -lrb- 15 gbp each -rrb- , but he instead offer that he could get we a private car direct to the airport for 35 gbp , which be what we do .
this be perfect , because it get we door-to-door from the hotel to LHR Terminal 3 with no hassle at all .
I would not have do that from lhr to the hotel , but since the concierge be arrange it , I feel that it would be safe , and the driver turn out to be pretty nice .
overall , it be a enjoyable , but really exhausting trip -lrb- we live in the suburb , so I guess we be not use to walk everywhere -rrb- .
luckily this be not a `` shopping '' trip , because thing be -lrb- at least from Americans -rrb- really expensive .
I think that if I be deal in gpb all the time , it would not seem so bad , but I remember sit at the ice cream -lrb- `` gelato '' ? -rrb-
counter at Harrods , and watch two little kid , each eat some sundae that cost 15 GPB each -lrb- $ 30.00 -rrb- , and think `` wow ! ''
.
Jim Deep Frayed Morgues Sun , 02 Jan 2005 10:41:54 GMT Re : post-trip report - London oh dear !
spot the Americans !
:o-rrb- Angus Steakhouse by any chance ?
I have never hear anything but bad stuff about they .
they be not british in the food sense , that be for sure .
pub food be usually a good bet in the UK .
that be a Europe thing .
the city invariably involve a lot of walk , and this be see as a pleasure , not a task .
that be very expensive , even by London standard .
Harrods be Harrods though , and most people go there to be blow away by the price .
of course everyone feel compel to buy ` something ' .
I opt for a few chocolate , which be very good .
good report of a good trip , even if you do fall for a couple of the tourist trap !

comment on suggest travel plan through New England Ringo Langly 27 Jan 2005 22:21:56 -0800 comment on suggest travel plan through New England Hi all , I live in Austin , tx , and be one who be only be as far as Nashville , Tn two friend and I be plan a trip to New England for a week .
I would love some insight or suggestion on we trip itinerary -- first i go to Expedia and do some flight check .
we be plan on go July 4th week -- what better time to be in Boston I figure :-rrb- Saturday , July 2nd - fly from Austin , tx to Boston and stay with friend live in Boston Sunday , July 3rd - Hang around Boston and stay with friend Monday , July 4th - Hang around Boston and stay with friend Tuesday , July 5th - leave early and drive to Niagara Falls , NY - 467 mile - Stay in Niagara Falls Wednesday , July 6th - leave from Niagara Falls and drive to Toronto , on - 85 mile - drive back to Niagara Falls that evening - 85 mile - Stay in Niagara Falls Thursday , July 7th - leave Niagara Falls and drive to Red Bank , NY - 435 mile - Stay in Red Bank for the night - we want to hit-up Jay and Silent Bob 's silent Stash Friday , July 8th - drive back to Boston pass through New York -- do whatever -- 262 Miles from Red bank to Boston but add whatever mile from New York - Stay the night with friend in Boston Saturday , July 9th - fly back to Austin I figure stay in Red Bank , NJ , which be not far from NYC , be cheaper then stay in the city .
plus while drive back north to Boston we can spend the day in NYC .
I know there be way too much to do , but I have another friend who work at the met I will try to hook-up with .
we will plan we few hour in NYC wisely .
also we be hang in Boston for so many night to visit with the friend there and hit the sight in that area .
also this be a vacation , so we hope to spend some time just chill .
any suggestion on change ?
we have 3 people go , and Expedia show the flight -lrb- round trip -rrb- and a rental car with unlimited mile be $ 1430 , plus I be figure about $ 150 for gas and at $ 120 a night for hotel that be $ 360 total for that .
so total cost -lrb- without food , spend cash , parking , toll road , etc -rrb- be $ 1910 or about $ 637 each .
I be figure about $ 850 per person should be plenty for everything -- and that be not bad for 7 night in New Enland with all the stuff we be plan .
do I miss anything or do anyone see any suggestion or change that might either save money or make we trip more worthwild ?
thanks again , and take care , Ringo oh -- what kinda weather can we expect up there during July ?
Texas be in the 100 's normally , so I hope the average for July in New England be a fare bit cooler :-rrb- b Vaughan Fri , 28 Jan 2005 13:51:33 +0100 Re : comment on suggest travel plan through New England -lsb- snip -rsb- unless there be something in particular you want to see in Toronto , I do not see any reason to make this long side trip .
I would suggest head back to Red Bank or wherever and try to carve out a extra day in New York City .
you can find hotel in you price range , especially with three share a room .
you might want to drop off the car somewhere near Red Bank , or as soon as you arrive in New York , if the drop off charge be not too much .
then you could spend part of one day in New York -lrb- and a good part of the next day , assume you drop Toronto -rrb- .
then you could take the train or bus back to Boston .
it might work out cheaper in the long run , especially when you consider the cost of parking in New York .

Ringo Langly 28 Jan 2005 06:42:55 -0800 Re : comment on suggest travel plan through New England .
Hi everyone , thanks for all the great reply !!
this be exactly what I be look for :-rrb- the main reason I would like to goto Toronto and Niagara Falls be mainly because it be so close .
.
but I agree New York would be nice to spend a few day in .
I know the bulk of we trip be in Boston , but we have friend live up there we hope to spend a few day with visit .
the trip be both to visit with they and to spend time around New England .
as for gas , what be the go rate for gas right now in New England ?
here in Texas it be around $ 1.60 - $ 1.75 for Reg Unleadded , but i be figure $ 1.90 a gallon .
be this not accurate ?
here be how I figure the price I be factor in -- Boston to Niagara Falls - 467 Miles Niagara Falls to Toronto - 85 Miles and 85 Miles back Niagara Falls to Red Bank , NJ - 435 Miles Red Bank , NJ to Boston -lrb- plus spend some time in NYC -rrb- - 262 Total be 1334 , but I be figure 1500 with some extra for around NYC and various town we visit .
we be get a mid-sized vehicle , so if the car get 20 mpg that be 75 gallon use .
this time $ 1.90 be $ 145.50 or around that .
even if gas be $ 2.00 a gallon that be still only around $ 150 , so I think $ 200 + for gas be a rather high estimate .
also be it possible to take a train from Boston to NYC ?
if so how do that work or what be the cost ?
I be from Texas where we drive everywhere , and I have never even set foot on a train -- so forgive I if this be a weird question :-rrb- thanks again for all the insight and help .
though I have never be up there I have always want to see both Niagara Falls and Toronto , so be so close I almost hate to miss a opportunity .
take care , Ringo

the administration 's approach to history be at odds with what have be describe by a communication adviser to the president as the `` reality-based community . ''
a dumb phrase , but not a dumb thought : he mean that the administration see history as dynamic and changeable , not static and impervious to redirection or improvement .
that be the Bush administration way , and it happen to be realistic : history be dynamic and changeable .
on the other hand , some thing be constant , such as human imperfection , injustice , misery and bad government .

the president 's speech seem rather heavenish .

well that be a ambition , and if you be go to have a ambition it might as well be a big one .
but this declaration , which be not wrong by any means , seem to I to land somewhere between dreamy and disturbing .

again , this be not heaven , it be earth .

when be a election not a election ?
ltlee1 3 Feb 2005 06:39:37 -0800 when be a election not a election ?
Sunnis say Iraq poll illegitimate .
be there minimal requirement before a election can be consider a legitimate election ?
the recent Iraq election be boycott by the Sunnis which constitute about 20 % of the population .
for example , in a city of 200,000 only 1400 have cast they vote .
many of the 1400 be civil worker and police be Shiites from the south .
in Fallujah , there be 5 voting station with only one vote cast .
be they boycott reasonable ?
if so , should that affect the legitimacy of the election ?
------------------ Sunnis say Iraq poll illegitimate a lead group of iraqi sunnus cleric have say the country 's landmark election lack legitimacy as so many Sunnis do not take part in the vote .
the cleric have encourage Sunnis to boycott the election because of the presence of US and foreign troops .
the US and iraqi authority , as well as the United Nations , have hail the election as a `` victory for democracy '' .
but the Association of muslim scholar say any government elect in the poll will not reflect the people 's will .
`` these election lack legitimacy because a large segment of different sect , party and current with they influence in Iraq boycott , '' the association say in a statement .
`` this necessarily mean the coming national assembly and government that will emerge from it will not possess the legitimacy to enable they to draft the come constitution , '' it say .
the group say whilst it would respect the choice of Iraqis who have choose to vote , it would regard the new government as have only limited power .
-lsb- ... -rsb- PeterL Thu , 3 Feb 2005 08:29:55 -0800 Re : when be a election not a election ?
I guess ltlee be a expert on the legitimacy of a election , as the Chinese have so much experience run election .

no .

ltlee be pretty good to see other problem .
but he do not see he own problem or problem near he -lrb- china -rrb- .
that sound like we eye when we be old , see thing far but forget the nearby .
remember the phoilosopher who observe the star in the sky and fall down by kick a rock he do not see ?
urillan 3 Feb 2005 09:46:15 -0800 Re : when be a election not a election ?
sunnus say the poll be now illegitimate because they choose not to vote .
fundamentally , choose not to vote be actually a vote for the other side .
if you choose not to vote , then you choose to give you opponent all the power .
if the Sunni 's be prevent , or restricted or otherwise not allow to vote , then they could claim illegitimacy , but since the simply just collectively decide not to vote , then they declare the vote legitimate of they own volition whilest simultaneously cede power to all non-sunnis .
if one slice off one 's nose to spite they face , then nobody should be surprise about they complaint of bleeding .
this be another case of `` well what do you bloody well expect to happen '' ?
ltlee1 3 Feb 2005 10:30:01 -0800 Re : when be a election not a election ?
you be talk about physically restricted to vote at election day .
however , it be not the Sunni cleric ' complaint .
rather , they state reason be relate to the reality that Iraq be currently under occupation .
do the presence of foreign troops make they less free ?
be they consult on set the date of election and how to distribute seat from the vote gain ?
in addition , they be restricted from move freely in they own country and/or they own city , would that not restricted they election related activity ?
well , I raise the question because the situation be novel .
America invasion , occupation Iraqis be unprovoked .
urillan 3 Feb 2005 15:32:17 -0800 Re : when be a election not a election ?
they state reason for not vote be because the country be under occupation .
they face , however , no pressure from the rest of the country , nor from the `` occupy '' force to stay away from the vote .
the Sunni 's now claim that the vote be not legitimate because they do not vote .
it be not they right to decide the legitimacy of the vote .
the Sunni 's have all the power about a year ago .
then they , the minority , be topple , and they use they power to intimidate and threaten shi'ite through the entire period .
who do you think the insurgent be kill -- shi'ite .
if anyone have a right to call the election `` illegitimate '' it would be the shi'ite .
they be invite to participate in each such decision .
they be not restrict from move within they own country .
the Shi'ites have no problem turn out in large group .
the situation be hardly novel .
it happen in Japan from 1945 through 1947 .

zhen 10 Feb 2005 10:58:36 -0800 Re : NORTH KOREA say it have nuclear weapon Jim , the Hmong will not be sit and watch from the sideline .
America have position its piece on the chess board of global domination very carefully .
here be the option : 1 .
the US will use Hmong American sentiment against lpdr as the start point for a regime change in Laos .
however , Laos be not the goal ; checkmate be the fall of China , and economic control of China .
the US will support one or two Hmong individual to speak out against lpdr human rights violation and Chao Fa resistance fighter .
with a precedant set in Iraq for preemptive attack , Laos will be take overnight and become a source of invaluable logistics for U.S. military attack on China .
2 .
the US 's policy of hand out NTR will have the desire effect of reel in alliance from the surrounding country of China .
Laos already have NTR .
we shall wait and see if chinese fat or american fat taste better to LPDR .
if lpdr play ball with Uncle Sam , then there will be no bloodshed in Laos .
when the Americans get into Laos , the artificial cooperation will be sufficient for some strategic political change .
some Hmong Americans may be reintroduce to Laos .
some Hmong in Laos , namely , Chao Fa , will be a good source of intelligence on Lao-China border activity .
this will be Chao Fa 's chance to replace they diet of tree root with rice and fish .
again , America have lpdr under its control , and America can launch airstrike and ground unit from Laos .
3 .
regardless of what happen , the U.S. have a direct ethnic connection to China by way of Hmong , which will secure CIA-insurgency operation .
unlike the current situation in the Middle-East , where the number of arabic-speaking CIA agent be few , there will be plenty of hmong/chinese-speaking CIA agent for disposal and use in the loom sino-us war .
perhaps by route of Thailand , if lpdr do not cooperate , the US will incite insurrection in the southern province of China .
these province have a lot of Hmong people , and have be know to be the fiercest opposition to chinese rule -lrb- aka remember the Miao Rebellions ? -rrb-
.
this will be the Hmong 's god-given chance to fight for they own country .
let 's see if they -lrb- and we -rrb- agree to a coaltion government like the Kurds in Iraq .
those be just 3 option .
they all involve Hmong people .
read between the line , the war will not be between the US and North Korea .
China be use North Korea to escalate sino-us relation and test Uncle Sam 's temper .
I sure hope I be not sit and watch when this all go down .
this be the perfect opportunity .
as Hmong people say , `` Water run strongly , engine sound good . ''

Enron & India Patrick Powers 4 Nov 2004 20:48:36 -0800 Enron & India in India , Bechtel along with General Electric be the new owner of the notorious and currently defunct Enron power project .
the Enron contract , which legally bind the government of the state of Maharashtra to pay Enron a sum of 30 billion dollar , be the largest contract ever sign in India .
Enron be not shy to boast about the million of dollar it have spend to `` educate '' indian politician and bureaucrat .
the Enron contract in Maharashtra , which be India 's first ` fast-track ' private power project , have come to be know as the most massive fraud in the country 's history .
-lrb- Enron be another of the Republican Party 's major campaign contributor -rrb- .
the electricity that Enron produce be so exorbitant that the government decide it be cheaper not to buy electricity and pay Enron the mandatory fixed charge specify in the contract .
this mean that the government of one of the poorest country in the world be pay Enron 220 million US dollar a year not to produce electricity !
now that Enron have cease to exist , Bechtel and GE be sue the indian government for 5.6 billion US dollar .
this be not even a minute fraction of the sum of money that they -lrb- or Enron -rrb- actually invest in the project .
once more , it be a projection of profit they would have make have the project materialize .
zztop8970 fri , 05 Nov 2004 15:36:53 GMT Re : Enron & India for a slightly different perspective : `` Maharashtra official say the cost of power supply by Enron be nearly double the tariff charge by indian power producer , and use it as a excuse to stop pay state debt to the plant . ''
`` Enron have sign a power purchase agreement with power utility mseb eight year ago , under which a $ 3bn 2,182 megawatt power plant be to be commission .
but the project run into trouble nearly two year ago with the indian authority begin to delay payment say Enron 's power tariff be too high ... Though Enron official refuse to talk about the price they would be willing to sell they stake at , analyst say the US company be demand about one billion dollar for its investment in India .
so far it have only get offer of about half that amount from indian company and financial institution , but Enron be unwilling to sell its stake at a price lower than the cost .
in case no satisfactory offer come from the indian side , Enron will have little option but to go for international arbitration as they investment in the country be guarantee by the indian government .
but arbitration proceedings can be a long and messy affair .
analyst say both India and Enron have little to gain from a protracted legal battle .
the best way out could be a compromise by which Enron get less than what it be demand and more than what the Indians be presently offer .
IOW : No fraud , just a basic business dispute , in which the party renege on its obligation be the gov ' t of Maharashtra .
the Maharashtra official be either incompetent fool , or worse - malicious fraudster who con a international comapny into build a state-of-the-art power plant for they at a cost of billion of dollar , and then refuse payment , know the company have no legal recourse except lengthy international arbitration , and will likely sell the plant to they for a fraction of its true value .

Iraq election at this point rhooker...@hotmail.com 11 Feb 2005 01:45:13 -0800 Iraq election at this point this be get strange .
I actually can not recall it ever take 2 week to `` count '' these many ballot , generally election be call within 24 hour .
in this case counting be take 2 week .
what be strange be everyone know who win , Sistani win .
he party , the major winner , could not field canidate until just before the election , but it be he face on all the poster and he part wipp up the heavily funded US support government .
so we have the voice of the people of Iraq , even if the Sunni 's have vote Sistani would still be the majority leader .
but he be not run .
so the US have enter in to the classic shia quicksand of islamic republic , which have cause it such problem in Iran .
Sistani will run Iraq , or the election will be ignore .
the problem with Sistani run Iraq be he refuse to talk to the Ameircans , and as the real power broker what ever figure head take the PM and other post will speak with as little authority as they counter part in Iran .
the US be now fight a war for a nation who government they have no direct tie with .
the other option , and what the US seem to be try , be to somehow fudge the election so Sistani do not win , that raise doubt about the outcome , claim fraud , do anything so that the election cause to result .
give the american attention span be about 10 minut the creation of a dictatorship of US puppet against the election would be ignore in the US .
this would actually be not only in the US best interest , but might be militarily necessary .
I can not imagine how the US occupation could operate in a situation where Sistani have the ultimate power .
in the long run I can not see how Iraq can avoid civil war , since its have it so many time in the past .
civil war lead to the victory of one group be the norm in Iraq , and be the casue of most mass grave in the 1980s and 1990s .
likely only sanction have kill more .
Sistani have the popular support and the claim of the election which the Ameircans bungle baddly and allow he to take over .
the Sunni 's have the weapon , the skill , and the support .
the US occupation be become more difficult by the day and Bush have show he fail to understand the situation .
hell when the worst possible event in the election be happen , Sistani be flood the poll with he supporter Bush be crow .
sadly Bush 's concern be short-term politics in the South of Ameirca , and they have already decide they do not have to pay attention to Iraq .
with more and mmore sunnus support the insurgent Iran , the big winner in all of this , will feel the need to back Sistani in the south .
so if the US leave its possible we could see Iraq carve up between the group .
as for a civil war , its already start .
old hoodoo Fri , 11 Feb 2005 10:30:44 -0600 Re : Iraq election at this point it be pretty bizarre , consider how long they have to organize election .
it may be that they want the public to get adjust to the fact that the shia 's be take over before announce official result .
the US be not go to change the result .
a shia government will allow we a exit strategy .
all we have win in iraq be maybe a shaky neutrality .
its not like Germany or Japan where they be so terrify of the Soviets post war that they be happy to see the US stick around .
I myself would have be happier with a mushariff military dictatorship or junta take over .
that be the only way to keep religion out of run the government .
in my opinion , all we have to the average iraqi citizen be bring a new type of domination .
many small business will have to close down -lrb- alcohol relate -rrb- woman will have to dress head to toe again , etc. .
there be only one ray of hope , that Sistani will prove a very strong leader and actually care about the moderate muslim in he country and protect they .
its a wait and see game as for the Sunnis , they be probably go to have to be crush .

I have read quite a few more rational work describe how the US be do its best to avoid , or at the very least postpone , a war against Japan , mainly because FDR be try to provoke Hitler to war and do not need a distraction on another distant front .
work ?
-lrb- stuff delete -rrb- the thesis have be expound by several conspiracy theorist , mainly the one who expound that FDR know Pearl Harbor be about to be attack , and let it happen .
one of they `` proof '' be that the US carrier be out of port during the attack , and `` everybody know '' carrier be the capital ship of the future .
however , the two carrier operate out of Pearl at the moment be send West with light escort , on possibly intersect route with the IJN Kido Butai , which have far more carrier and a far heavier escort .
even stranger , the USS Enterprise be schedule to be at Pearl by Dec 6th , but get delay by a storm .
consequently , for the ph conspiracy theorist to believe that FDR keep the carrier out of harm 's way , we not only have to grant FDR the full knowledge of Kido Butai 's route of approach would not result in either USN carrier fleet get catch in a hopeless battle , but that FDR could psychically manipulate the weather to prevent Halsey from sail into Pearl and thus be ambush .
to make a very long story short , it be foolish to assume that the US want to go to war against Japan prior to 1941 , consider the weight of evidence argue against a US desire for war , and the overwhelming lack of evidence -lrb- not to mention rational thought -rrb- argue for a US desire for war .

here 's something I write as part of a larger article , some while ago : be not Japan just defend herself when she attack the US ?
this line of reasoning seem to derive from argument that Japan be be `` drive into a corner '' by sanction , and have no choice but to attack the US .
Meiji Japan be drive to emulate what it think the West be do in every facet of society .
they have observe , for example , that the West be able to carve up China into `` sphere of influence '' , and be able to do from great distance , while they , the Japanese , have have limit success in they previous attempt to dominate the korean peninsula , much less China .
as part of the catch-up effort , she whole-heartedly enter into the Imperialist game in Asia , be treat as a equal -lrb- relative to she power -rrb- by the other power .
however , after World War I , Japan fail to recognize a fundamental shift in the attitude of she former Imperial partner ; they begin a long , slow process of disengage themselves from they former Imperial area , from they colony , in addition to outright stop all expansion .
Japan choose to read this as a sign that the West have lose its power and resolve , and that Japan be the rightful heir to Imperial mantle in Asia .
with the death of many of the idealistic leader who have lead Japan 's rise to international prominence , and the refusal of the US to intervene in asian affair , in addition to the Bolshevik revolution and the strip of possession from Germany , Britain find herself alone in deal with a increasingly aggressive Japan in the area .
have a keen grasp of the obvious , she begin a policy of accede to japanese hegemony in the area .
Japan continue a policy of acquire territory for some grand , illusive scheme of a `` Greater Asia '' , subordinate and grateful to Japan .
the reality of this be that only a single possession , Manchuria , be profitable to the Japanese , and the rest of the Empire turn out to be a drain .
this drain be greatly accelerate by Japan 's invasion of China proper in 1936 .
it be a war that Japan assume would be end in `` 3 to 6 month '' ; at the time of Pearl Harbor , it have be go on for 5 year , at the cost of over half a million japanese life .
the war put a tremendous strain on Japan -lrb- and be in fact oppose by more radically nationalistic element , as take away from the development of Japan 's other possession , particularly in the area of scrap metal and fuel . -rrb-
domestic consumption fall , consumer goods become scarce , and the use of materiale for war purpose eat into Japan 's domestic industry .
this cut further into she foreign reserve , exacerbate the economic impact of the war .
the war effort take on a life of its own , however , and common sense be subordinate to it .
Japan expand into area of China and Indochina which have no strategic value to she , but put she in a position to threaten british and dutch possession in the area ; possession that both those allied nation need in order to continue they fight against Hitler .
at this point , the US stop ignore the japanese threat , and impose a series of escalate sanction on Japan , cut off she scrap metal , limitting and then cut off she oil -lrb- Japan import most of both from the US . -rrb-
while japanese official realize that they have enough of each resource for Japan to do well if the war in CHINA stop , they be powerless over the military they be suppose to control .
a abortive attack on soviet position in Mongolia have place Japan 's focus firmly south , towards the possession of the US ' future ally .
for no reason anyone could articulate , Japan feel she have to continue the war in China .
to continue the war in China , she have to have resource of oil and metal .
to have these resource , she must seize they , if other refuse to sell they .
in order to seize they , she feel she have to attack and destroy the naval power of the US .
thus , for a `` 3 to 6 month '' operation in China in 1937 , Japan would embark on a war that would strip she of all the possession and industry she have acquire in 70 year .

the 1860 Presidential Election Machiavegli 29 Jan 2005 22:04:38 GMT the 1860 Presidential Election in 1860 there be a four-way race between the Republican Party with Abraham Lincold , the Democratic Party with Stephen Douglas , the Southern Democratic Party with John Breckenridge , and the Constitutional Union Party with John Bell .
Lincoln win a plurality with about 40 % of the vote .
WI it be only a two-way race between Lincoln and Douglas ?
I believe Douglas would have win .
this would have delay secession and the civil war .
David Tenner sit , 29 Jan 2005 17:21:13 -0600 Re : the 1860 Presidential Election machiave...@aol.com -lrb- Machiavegli -rrb- write in `` one feature of the result must not be omit .
many careless observer feel at the time that the success of Lincoln be due entirely to the fact of there have be three oppose candidate in the field ; or , in other word , to the dissension in the democratic party , which divide its vote between Breckinridge and Douglas .
what merely moral strength the democratic party would have gain have it remain united , it be impossible to estimate .
such a supposition can only be base on the absence of the extreme Southern doctrine concern slavery .
give the presence of those doctrine in the canvass , no hypothesis can furnish a result different from that which occur .
in the contest upon the question as they exist , the victory of Lincoln be certain .
if all the vote give to all the oppose candidate have be concentrate and cast for a ` fusion ticket , ' as be wholly or partly do in five state , the result would have be change nowhere except in New Jersey , California , and Oregon ; Lincoln would still have receive but 11 fewer , or 169 electoral vote -- majority of 35 in the entire electoral college . ''
Abraham Lincoln , a history , volume 2 by John George Nicolay and John Hay see for a confirmation of the electoral arithmetic : the state where Lincoln get a abolute majority of the popular vote -lrb- i.e. , all the free state except Oregon , California , and New Jersey -rrb- be sufficient to bring he a majority in the Electoral College .
the reason that Lincoln could get a electoral majority with only forty percent of the popular vote be not that he opposition be divide but that he have far fewer `` waste '' vote than he opponent -- in ten southern state he get no popular vote at all .
it can of course be argue that the candidate of a unite anti-lincoln opposition might have do better than all the OTL anti-lincoln candidate combine , because the mere fact of the divide nature of Lincoln 's opposition might have discourage anti-lincoln man and lead to fewer of they vote than would otherwise be the case .
but give that turnout be quite high in 1860 , I doubt this .
one thing seem reasonably clear to I : if there be to be a unite anti- Lincoln opposition , Douglas could not lead it .
he be hate too much in the South for he opposition to the admission of Kansas as a state under the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution and for he interpretation of Dred Scott as still allow territory to exclude slavery through unfriendly local legislation .
-lrb- see for Douglas 's defense of he position . -rrb-
he and Breckinridge and Bell would have to withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate -- former governor Horatio Seymour of New York be one proposal .
but I doubt that Seymour would have be able to do better than all the combined otl anti-lincoln candidate in such close state as Illinois and Indiana and he own state of New York be not really close enough for I to believe he could have take that state from the Lincoln column .

another possibility be to change the meeting time .

in fairness , reimbursement of out-of-pocket expense on behalf of the organization -- include travel and lodging to attend board meeting -- be allow .

as far as state law go , you must follow the law for the state -lrb- 1 -rrb- in which the organization be incorporate and -lrb- 2 -rrb- in which the organization operate .
for a organization that be incorporate in Maryland and have its headquarters in Maryland , the law of Maryland apply without regard to the state in which the director live .
remember , a corporation be legally a `` person '' , distinct from the corporeal person who govern , manage , and operate the corporation .
thus , the law apply to the corporate person be the law of the state where that person `` life '' .

it be not acceptable policy and not legal to pay a honorarium or stipend to director of charity .

the prohibition do not apply to director of nonprofit organization that be not charity .
in the USA , the rule vary from state to state .
some state permit board member of charity to be compensate , but it be generally not do .
donor , funder , and the general public share the view that director of charity should act gratuitiously .

Iran to continue policy of Shooting-Down US Spy Drones Michael Ejercito 17 Feb 2005 09:39:05 -0800 Re : Iran to continue policy of Shooting-Down US Spy Drones I wonder why the Army and Marines do not deploy infantry combat drone .

Hmmm ... now if the drone aircraft could lift a drone soldier and parachute ... .
oh well , I do not think there be really much we can do about iranian nuke .
Learning from other mistake they have widely disperse they facility , even put some in dense urban area .
we will just have to lay down the law relative to what happen if iranian uranium be find in a terrorist nuke .

Holocaust Day Thomas Bauer Thu , 27 Jan 2005 08:11:09 GMT Holocaust Day yet again I notice that the media see gay as ` invisible ' when it come to Holocaust Day .
this morning , when talk about the horror of Auswitch on the BBC Breakfast programme , they refer to the slaughter of thousand of Jews and other .
surely gay and gypsy warrant more than to be refer to as ` other ' .
you would not know anything about the slaughter of gay if you only listen to the BBC .
lyn David Thomas Thu , 27 Jan 2005 08:21:22 GMT Re : Holocaust Day on Thu , 27 Jan 2005 08:11:09 gmt I have just -lrb- in the last 1/2 hour -rrb- hear Radio Wales refer to the million of Jews and other minorite include gypsy and homosexual who die in the concentration camp .
Thomas Bauer Thu , 27 Jan 2005 10:17:33 GMT Re : Holocaust Day good Thomas Bauer Peter Corlett Thu , 27 Jan 2005 11:39:03 GMT Re : Holocaust Day the ` other ' be name on radio 4 's today .
seem that those who listen to the BBC know , but those who watch it do not :p -- this woman do not fly to extreme ; she live there .
- Quentin Crisp Peter Ould Thu , 27 Jan 2005 13:11:44 GMT Re : Holocaust Day hello Thomas , as mention in `` The Final solution '' thread , the number of man kill for be homosexual be at the most 10-15 ,000 .
now that be significant , but compare to the genocide of Jews and Zigeuner it be not as significant -lrb- though of course to the family and love one of those who die every single one be significant -rrb- .
not try to deny it happen , just try to see some perspective .
I for one say Kaddish this morning and will do so again at dusk .
Peter O Vicky Thu , 27 Jan 2005 21:06:15 GMT Re : Holocaust Day I be watch the BBC news this morning and they interview the man who be go to be in charge of Holocaust Day , certainly in the future .
he very specifically mention gay , along with black and roma , and say that he be go to try and link future day to the danger of current prejudice and oppression .
John L Fri , 28 Jan 2005 01:23:42 GMT Re : Holocaust Day this be a bit like rating Stalin and Hitler for badness purely on the grounds of the number of death they be responsible for .
it be `` significant '' if any group of people be identify for liquidation by the government of the country in which they live , surely ?
if there be not as many identifiable individual from a particular group in the general population , then by you significance = headcount yardstick some group be never ever go to get rate as `` significant '' .
in some way , it be amazing that the Nazis be able to identify even * two * thousand homosexual in the Thirties .
by a bitter irony , without the burgeon gay liberation movement in Germany -lrb- Magnus Hirschfeld et al -rrb- the issue may not even have arise .
John L Thomas Bauer Fri , 28 Jan 2005 11:37:23 GMT Re : Holocaust Day that be good .
I do get a email back from the BBC say that they understand what I be say and would try to be more inclusive .
Thomas Bauer Peter Ould Fri , 28 Jan 2005 12:14:56 GMT Re : Holocaust Day hello John , I be simply try to get some perspective .
the Holocaust of the Jews and Zigeuner be motivate by racial prejudice .
the murder of -lrb- at the most -rrb- 10k homosexual be not .
most homosexual arrest during the nazi era be imprison in normal jail .
if you be homosexually orient but do nothing with it the law in 30s Germany could not touch you .
the Jews and Zigeuner on the other hand be kill simply for they ontological state .
once again , I be not diminish the horror of any individual murder , just try to get it into perspective .
Peter O Robert Marshall Fri , 28 Jan 2005 14:13:10 GMT Re : Holocaust Day Hang on a moment up there you say it be shrink , I think you agenda be show !
and that previous quote say a rather important qualification .
I think the chance of they be only 10000 who be homosexual amongst the how ever million be kill in the camp be rather small .
Records appear to show that 50000 _ man _ be convict of homosexuality during the nazi rule , find out how many be send to a camp and kill there be more difficult especially as some who be send to normal jail be transfer to camp at the end of they sentence , but 10-15k seem reasonable Robert
Scott 2004-11-01T11:44:00 Again I apologize for the lack of update over the past few day and will use this space to recap a weekend that be both good and bad .
the good : on Friday a small group of friend and I attend a most-righteous Sister Hazel concert at Floyd 's Music Store for the third straight , and for the third straight year I be blow away by one of my favorite live band .
Sister Hazel have a way of become intimate with the fan by brine they into the show .
it be something you can always expect from these guy , unlike so many other performer , and be why I never miss a show when they be in town .
on Saturday we host what be for the most part a largely successful Halloween party -- save for the fake blood stain on the carpet and bathroom wall , a couple beer spill , unnecessary fight and the expect trashing of the kitchen and living room area .
naturally , I dress up as Hugh Hefner and take the role of make sure everyone be have a good time .
I have yet to hear any complaint from any of the guest .
the Bad : on Saturday the Seminoles be best by unranked Maryland ; effectively end we chance at a national title this year .
in addition , the quarterback controversy have once again debouch as Chris Rix almost take we to victory with he deep threat .
alas , too little too late be the case thanks to the inept Wyatt Sexton who have be we starter since replace Rix earlier in the season .
fortunately the agony of defeat be blanket somewhat by we Halloween party and I will not have to worry about Seminole Football until next Saturday .
on Sunday we see `` see '' -lrb- review come -rrb- and as expect I be less than satisfied .
it be neither better nor worse than last week 's `` the Grudge '' but the trailer beforehand dictate that the end of this year and the beginning of 2005 will bring we a large quantity of horror movie .
if I enjoy one out of five consider the genre I can say it be worth it .
Scott 2004-11-01T18:06:00 I wish I could have be at a pub , or wherever these people convene , to see the reaction from all the Britons who read the Telegraph this morning -lrb- emphasis add -rrb- : Britain 's gun law be aim at the wrong target , curb and criminalise legal ownership while fail to tackle huge rise in shooting offence over the past few year , accord to a international firearm legislation expert .
Prof Gary Mauser say that Britain be make the same mistake as Canada and Australia in focus on legal owner - a section of the law-abiding community where gun crime , such as the Dunblane massacre , be aberration .
the Home Office and police chief should instead tackle the possession of gun in criminal hand , say Prof Mauser , a member of the independent Fraser Institute in Canada .
he have give evidence to select committee of the House of Commons and the canadian Senate and predict the escalation of gun crime on Britain 's street .
he warning come as gun crime incident be average about 29 a day in England and Wales , more than twice the level of when the labour government come to power in 1997 .
in the past two year , there have be case of schoolchildren and a baby , kill or injure by gun .
`` I believe that factor of political correctness be at work , '' he say .
`` police crackdown , Home Office initiative and over-regulation of legally hold weapon create froth and they may even fool the police themselves into believe they be do something about gun crime . ''
Prof Mauser add : `` the sad truth be that while the police officer be inspect farmer ' gun cabinet to see if they comply with regulation somewhere in the UK , someone , who have not fill in a firearm certificate form , will be smuggling a gun into the country or sell one to a inner city youth . ''
record gun crime rise by three per cent to 10,590 incident in the year to June .
two-third of gun crime take place in London , Birmingham and Manchester .
it do not matter to these people that crime have skyrocket since the irrational ban on private gun possession go into effect in Great Britain .
just as long as it be there , they feel safe .
Scott 2004-11-16T13:47:00 from Reuters : U.S. Marines rally round a comrade under investigation for kill a wound iraqi during the offensive in Falluja , say he be probably under combat stress in unpredictable , hair-trigger circumstance .
Marines interview on Tuesday say they do not see the shooting as a scandal , rather the act of a comrade who face intense pressure during the effort to quell the insurgency in the city .
`` I can see why he would do it .
he be probably run around be shoot at for day on end in Falluja .
there should be a investigation but they should look into the circumstance , '' say Lance corporal Christopher Hanson .
`` I would have shoot the insurgent too .
two shot to the head , '' say Sergeant Nicholas Graham , 24 , of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .
`` you can not trust these people .
he should not be investigate .
he do nothing wrong . ''
of course the anti-american world press be jump all over this story , casually omit the fact that just a day earlier the marine in question lose a fellow soldier who be attend to a dead insurgent that be booby-trapped with explosive .
add the tactic of booby-trap you own dead to the effective suicide bombing , and it be clear to say that the Geneva Convention be not on the mind of the insurgent .
for that I believe the Marines should handle dead and wounded insurgent by any means necessary to ensure they own safety and prevent a possible ambush .
I be no fan of this war either , but it irk I to no end reading and listen to civilian opinion on how soldier should conduct themselves in hostile war zone from they comfortable recliner .
to the world press and everyone else who despise the United States : you do not have to like we president or those operate this war , but get off the back of the 18 , 19 and 20 year-old throw into a situation you will never see or have to encounter .
I have get too many friend in Iraq right now I want to see come home alive and well , and I will support they at every opportunity .
Scott 2004-12-01T23:13:00 more than a few e-mail have come in wonder why I have not remark on the horrible hunting tragedy on Nov. 21 that leave six people dead , and why I have not update the ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN COUNTER .
I do not mean to wait this long and never intend to ignore the issue , but I have be extremely busy last week with Thanksgiving and everything that go along with it .
this be problem that need to be address .
but as for the assault weapon ban issue , the man accuse of the brutal killing , Chai Vang of St. Paul , Minn , use a russian-built Saiga 7.62 mm , sk semiautomatic rifle .
as this article point out , the sk be not include on the list of ban weapon as part of the 10-year ban on certain `` assault weapon '' sign by President Clinton .
the ban expire in September and at the time of this post , no one have be kill by any one of those weapon since the ban expire .
but let 's talk about this case , as I be sure discussion have start and many want stronger gun control because of this freak incident .
while the media use word like `` military style , '' `` assault '' and `` semiautomatic , '' the gun use in the slaying be not unlike a typical hunting rifle .
the sk be a medium-powered carbine equip with a 10-round magazine , just like the pistol I be display in the photo on the left hand side of this blog .
ban weapon have capacity of more than 10 round ; so like my small 9mm , the sk be not classify as a `` assault '' weapon .
so let 's not center we discussion around the gun , let 's talk about the person behind the trigger .
if convict of the killing , Vang face life in prison as Minnesota do not honor the death penalty .
I look forward to Vang 's conviction and I pray for the family of the victim .
what happen be indefensible and justice must be serve .
Scott 2004-12-03T19:59:00 here be a incredible story about a unsung hero until now .
from BBC News : A retire italian doctor have reveal for the first time how he invent a fictitious disease which fool the Nazis during World War II .
the trick of prescribe jew with a mysterious illness terrify the Nazis and save 45 Roman Jews .
Dr Vittorio Sacerdoti have tell he remarkable tale on the 60th anniversary of liberation of Rome .
just 28 year old at the time , he use courage and ingenuity to save 45 people from certain death .
as other Jews be be round up , Dr Sacerdoti admit anyone who could reach the hospital as patient - and diagnose they with a dangerous disease .
`` we would write on they medical form that the patient be suffer from K syndrome , '' he say .
`` we call it K after the german commander kesserling - the Nazis think it be cancer or tuberculosis , and they flee like rabbit . ''
K syndrome save he cousin , Luciana Sacerdoti , who be just 10 year old .
`` the day the Nazis come to the hospital , someone come to we room and say : ` you have to cough , you have to cough a lot because they be afraid of the cough , they do not want to catch a awful disease and they will not enter ' . ''
Scott 2004-12-08T21:33:00 Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld take part in a q&a with the troops today that be anything but cozy .
disgruntled soldier complain to Rumsfeld about long deployment and a lack of armored vehicle and other equipment .
from the Associated Press : `` you go to war with the Army you have , '' Rumsfeld reply , `` not the Army you might want or wish to have . ''
Spc. Thomas Wilson have ask the defense secretary , `` why do we soldier have to dig through local landfill for piece of scrap metal and compromise ballistic glass to up-armor we vehicle ? ''
shout of approval and applause arise from the estimate 2,300 soldier who have assemble to see Rumsfeld .
`` we do not have proper armored vehicle to carry with we north , '' Wilson , 31 , of Nashville , Tenn. , conclude after ask again .
Wilson , a airplane mechanic whose unit , the 278th regimental Combat Team of the Tennessee Army National Guard , be about to drive north into Iraq for a one-year tour of duty , put he finger on a problem that have bedevil the Pentagon for more than a year .
rarely , though , be it put so bluntly in a public forum .
Rumsfeld say the Army be spare no expense or effort to acquire as many Humvees and other vehicle with extra armor as it can .
what be more , he say , armor be not the savior some think it be .
`` you can have all the armor in the world on a tank and a tank can -lrb- still -rrb- be blow up , '' he say .
ca not say that be the most comforting answer .
Scott 2004-12-15T23:02:00 from the Associated Press : City resident will vote next year on a propose weapon ban that would deny handgun to everyone except law enforcement officer , member of the military and security guard .
if pass next November , resident would have 90 day to give up firearm they keep in they home or business .
the proposal be immediately dismiss as illegal by a gun owner group .
firearm would be allow only for police officer , security guard , member of the military , and anyone else `` actually employ and engage in protect and preserve property or life within the scope of he or she employment , '' accord to the measure .
gun owner of California , a sacramento-based lobbying group , quickly call the ban illegal .
Sam Paredes , the group 's executive director , say state law bar local government from usurp the state 's authority to regulate firearm .
`` the amazing thing be they be go to turn San Francisco into ground zero for every criminal who want to profit at they choose profession , '' Paredes say .
Washington , D.C. , be the only major american city that currently ban handgun possession by private citizen .
Andrew Arulanandam , director of public affair for the National Rifle Association , say San Francisco would be remiss to use that city as a model .
`` if gun control work , Washington , D.C. , would be the beacon .
however , it be the murder capital of the United States , '' he say .
if approve , the weapon ban would take effect in January 2006 .
quote of the day : `` Firearms would be allow only for police officer , security guard , member of the military , and anyone else actually employ and engage in protect and preserve property or life within the scope of he or she employment . ''
so preserve property or life within the scope of self-defense and protection of the home be not allow .
no thanks .
if the people vote for this measure it will be hard to sympathize with they when robbery and rape rate skyrocket , because burgular will know home be not guard , and rapist will know the only thing stop they from the victim they desire be they own inhibition .
Scott 2004-12-18T01:46:00 San Francisco be apparently bore with just be the gay capital of America and be try to muscle out Washington DC for the prestigious title of murder capital .
it be possible , now that San Francisco official have propose a law that mimic the infamous dc gun ban .
Columnist Michelle Malkin be one of the few columnists/bloggers who have pick up on the story .
as I say in a previous post it be all up to the voter .
Scott 2004-12-18T10:04:00 from the Associated Press : A baby girl who have be cut out of she mother 's womb be find after a frantic search , and authority arrest the woman they say strangle the mother and steal the child .
the baby be in good condition Saturday .
Lisa M. Montgomery , 36 , of Melvern , Kan. , be arrest later Friday and charge with kidnapping result in death .
Bobbie Jo Stinnett , 23 , be find Thursday in a pool of blood inside she small white home in Skidmore , a town in northwest Missouri .
Stinnett , who be eight month pregnant , have earlier be talk with she mother on the phone , and hang up say a woman she have chat with online have just arrive at she door , authority say .
U.S. Attorney Todd Graves say Montgomery contact Stinnett through a online message board , and authority zero in on she use computer forensic .
Montgomery be seek to buy a dog from Stinnett , who raise rat terrier , he say .
accord to the criminal complaint , Montgomery travel about 40 mile to Topeka , Kan. , on Thursday to go shopping .
she husband receive a call from she say she have go into labor and give birth .
the next day , authority say , Montgomery confess that she strangle Stinnett from behind , cut she open , remove the baby and cut she umbilical cord .
I do not understand how we can call this fetus-thing that be rip from a mother 's womb a `` child '' or `` girl '' in a society that sanction partial-birth abortion .
if you can not charge someone for kill a fetus via abortion during the eighth month , then surely you can not make a big deal about a woman who kidnap a fetus that survive the knifing .
on a less-sarcastic note , I pray for the family of the 23-year-old woman .
no one should have to die because some crazy nut want a child and decide to kill for it .
if there be any good news in this story , it be that Victoria Jo will live on and carry she mother 's memory .
question for the pro-choicer : be that it be not yet the ninth month , can we still charge the killer with kidnapping ?
Scott 2004-12-23T14:49:00 this be absolutely amazing news .
finally , the Democrats be finally realize that the american people support the rights of unborn child and may soon revamp they platform to accommodate the moral and value that at least half of this country possess .
of course , I be sure the Democrats would also like to start win election again .
from the Los Angeles Times : after long define itself as a undisputed defender of abortion rights , the Democratic Party be suddenly lock in a internal struggle over whether to redefine its position to appeal to a broader array of voter .
the fight be a central theme of the contest to head the democratic National , particularly between two lead candidate : former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean , who support abortion rights , and former Indiana Rep. Tim Roemer , a abortion foe who argue that the party can not rebind from its loss in the November election unless it show more tolerance on one of society 's most emotional conflict .
no Democrat with any respect for he unraveling party would ever mention Howard Dean 's name again .
the fact that he do not win a single primary outside he home state show that the country do not embrace he radical liberalism .
of course outspoken organization such as Planned Parenthood , which give a lot of money to Democrats , will fight with everything they have get to keep the democratic platform as liberal as possible .
result from the last few election suggest that would not be such a good idea if they ever want to gain more power in Congress .
Scott 2004-12-26T17:12:00 Peyton Manning break Dan Marino 's season touchdown record today with 49 against the San Diego Chargers in a thrilling game that end in overtime .
I be happy to see Manning break the record , as last week he decide to take a knee to end the game against the Baltimore Ravens when he could have try to increase the lead even more by throw a touchdown .
man be all class and rank with the best quarterback of all time .
Marino 's 48 td record be set in 1984 .
on a much sadder note , the Minister of Defense , Reggie White , die of heart attack this morning in he home at the age of 43 .
White play a total of 15 year with Philadelphia , Green Bay and Carolina .
he retire after the 2000 season as the NFL 's all-time leader in sack with 198 .
the mark have since be pass by Bruce Smith .
White will surely be miss .
Scott 2005-01-05T13:44:00 perhaps Father Simpson be too busy tell reporter how hot he think he daughter , Jessica , be to wake and up and realize that he other daughter , Ashlee , be make a complete fool of herself .
back in November I link to this fraud 's malfunction snl performance when a technical glitch cause the vocal track from she first song to repeat during the second , prove she lip-synch , even though she have be quote say she do not .
the humiliation and assault-on-music continue last night , when for some reason she decide to use she own voice in a wretched halftime performance at the Orange Bowl which end in a shower of boo .
you can see the video here if you can stand to watch a young no-talent wannabe continue to humiliate herself in public .
the best thing Ms. Simpson can do at this point be to just stop try and end she music career .
she have already make enough money from she debut album -lrb- never again -rrb- to live out the rest of she life in some secluded California mansion .
there be nothing more to the story .
Scott 2005-01-06T13:10:00 Feminists have a reason to celebrate today as a appeal court just throw out the conviction of they martyr , Andrea Yates , by rule that one of the prosecutor 's expert witness give false testimony at she trial .
Yates , in case you have forget , be the woman from Texas who heinously drown she five kid , aged 6 month to 7 year , one by one , in she bathtub .
liberal feminist organization rush to Yates ' defense , most notably the National Organization for Women , which provide money for she defense fund and hold candlelight vigil .
no such ceremony be hold for she five dead child .
in 2002 a jury sentence Yates to life in prison for the death of three of she child .
she be not try in the death of the other two .
today the 1st court of Appeals overturn the conviction and order a new trial .
we can only hope for the same verdict .
Scott 2005-01-07T20:12:00 The blood red nation of China be try to curb the effect of a devastating 20-year-old policy that outlaw woman from have more than one child .
as a result , only about 100 girl be bear for every 119 boy , because couple traditionally favor male .
Beijing have set a goal of reverse the imbalance by 2010 , and to do this they will outlaw the selective abortion of female fetus to correct a imbalance in the ratio of boy to girl .
so now by kill the male they can hopefully narrow the gender gap .
what a country !
from Reuters : sex-selective abortion be already ban but technology such as ultrasound have make it easier to know a baby 's gender in advance , increase the chance for abort girl .
despite a desire to curb the sex imbalance and a relaxation in recent year that allow rural family to have two child if the first be a girl , China have show no sign of abandon the one-child policy and crack down on those who advocate against it .
one such activist be Mao Hengfeng , who be dismiss in 1988 from she job at a Shanghai soap factory after become pregnant a second time .
last April , the Shanghai public security bureau sentence she to 18 month in a labor camp for campaigning against the one-child policy .
in other news : feminist still believe they be second-class citizen in the United States .
Scott 2005-01-09T16:27:00 Planned Parenthood , one of the worst organization in the country , have be distribute poor condom -- which liberal believe should be freely available in all high school clinic nationwide -- accord to Consumer report which release its ranking this week .
from Sun-Sentinal : two of the three type of free condom offer by Planned Parenthood receive poor rating , accord to ranking that appear in the February issue of consumer report , which hit newsstand Wednesday .
Planned Parenthood have since redesign its `` Honeydew '' condom , which be the magazine 's lowest-ranked brand with two `` poor '' rating in strength and reliability .
the group resubmit all three of its brand for independent testing and receive `` excellent result , '' say Karen Pearl , president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Nassau County .
the group 's `` assorted color '' brand be rank next-to-last with a `` poor '' mark for strength but a `` excellent '' for reliability .
the `` Lollipop '' get a overall `` excellent '' rating .
Pretty scary that poorly rate condom have be available to teens , both those look for free sex and those who happen to attend public school .
even worse , it take a whistleblower to get Planned Parenthood to strengthen its product .
Lollipop anyone ?
Scott 2005-01-13T14:00:00 in a horribly deceitful manner , the Brady Campaign have release `` report card '' for every state on they gun law that supposedly shield child from gun violence .
thirty-one state receive either a `` d '' or a `` f '' from the anti-gun group .
I have get all the goods in a new article I write for GunControlPolicy.com .
not surprisingly my home state of Florida receive a `` d + '' for reason that be just plain laughable and of course have nothing to do with kid .
Scott 2005-01-14T19:22:00 from the Associated Press : a atheist who try to remove `` under God '' from the pledge of Allegiance lose a bid Friday to bar the say of a christian prayer at President Bush 's inauguration .
Newdow argue that say a christian prayer at the Jan. 20 ceremony would violate the Constitution by force he to accept unwanted religious belief .
attorney represent Bush and he inaugural committee argue that prayer have be widely accept at inaugural for more than 200 year and that Bush 's decision to have a minister recite the invocation be a personal choice the court have no power to prevent .
force he to accept unwanted religious belief ?
no wonder you can not win a argument against a secularist .
they believe any inclusion of religious belief in one 's own personal ceremony be somehow a operation to indoctrinate the hoi polloi .
Scott 2005-01-16T21:49:00 The Food and Drug Administration be consider whether to make morning-after birth control available without a prescription .
the FDA may decide as soon as this week whether drug store can sell the emergency contraception know as plan b without a prescription to woman age 16 and older .
here be where I break with my conservative base and support the availability of plan b which can prevent pregnancy for up to 72 hour after sex .
with a 89 % success rate , we can be optimistic that we be on the right path to end unwanted pregnancy that do not involve a scalpel or suction tube .
conservative say people will be less reluctant to have risky and unprotected sex if they have get a box of b under the nightstand where condom traditionally collect .
but I would rather plan b be use to prevent pregnancy than the liberal ' preferred method ; a fork in the head and a knife to the spinal cord .
Scott 2005-01-24T13:54:00 this past weekend mark the 32-year anniversary of Roe v. Wade , the landmark Supreme Court decision that give way for the imminent slaughter of 43 million unborn child across the country in the name of `` woman 's rights . ''
today , thousand of pro-life crusader will participate in the March for Life in Washington D.C. , to honor the defenseless child and hope for a eventual Supreme Court reversal .
a reversal would not only be a victory for those who value life , but also for the woman once know as Jane Roe -- now a passionate pro-life advocate try to get the Supreme Court to overturn the case she once represent .
Michelle Malkin have the goods on the March as well as link to other resource .
Scott 2005-01-25T01:36:00 from the Associated Press : The Supreme Court decline Monday to consider whether state may offer license plate with anti-abortion message , leave lower court divide over whether the program in a dozen state unconstitutionally restrict dissenting view .
without comment , justice let stand a lower court ruling that say South Carolina 's license plate , which bear the slogan `` choose Life , '' violate the First Amendment because abortion rights supporter be not give a similar forum to express they belief .
say what ??
now the First Amendment guarantee all side a fair voice ?
where be liberal when Ralf Nader want such equality ?
and who on Earth could possibly have a problem with someone who pay $ 70 that go to a local crisis pregnancy program for a anti-abortion license plate ?
oh that be right .
the dastardly people at Planned Parenthood .
because no one should be allow to express a opinion that challenge the belief of the american leave .
Scott 2005-02-03T13:56:00 A CNN poll ask reader to rate the president 's state of the Union speech last night .
after 90,000 vote Mr. Bush have a ` c-c + ' grade across the board , mean 45,000 republican give he a ` a ' and 45,000 liberal fail he .
but a new cnn/usa today/gallup poll suggest more people side with the president .
70 percent of respondent say Bush 's policy on health care be positive , while 66 percent approve of the president 's plan for Social Security .
78 percent say U.S. policy in Iraq be hade in the right direction , a 12 percentage point increase over pre-speech polling .
overall , 77 percent of respondent say Bush be take the country in the right direction after the speech compare to 67 percent beforehand .
and who be not move by the embrace of mother of a soldier kill in Iraq and the daughter of a man kill by Saddam Hussein 's regime ?
it be a beautiful moment last night that result in the longest standing ovation of the evening .
today the parent of Marine Corps Sgt. Byron Norwood say the iraqi woman , Safia Taleb al-Suhail , have turn and introduce herself just before the speech .
`` she thank we for we son 's sacrifice and make sure we know the people in Iraq be grateful for the sacrifice that be make not just by we son , but by all of they , '' Janet Norwood say .
it be a uplifting moment suggest that maybe we be do the right thing .
I talk to a friend currently serve in Iraq last night and he say morale be up and the presence of troops be a positive thing .
they just can not pack up and leave .
not just yet .
we must be patient .
Scott 2005-02-05T19:54:00 we have all live next to some pretty undesirable people at one point or another , but I can not imagine anyone be worse than this .
a Colorado judge order two teen-age girl to pay about $ 900 for the distress a neighbor say they cause by give she home-made cookie adorn with paper heart .
the pair be order to pay $ 871.70 plus $ 39 in court cost after neighbor Wanita Renea Young , 49 , file a lawsuit complain that the unsolicited cookie , leave at she house after the girl knock on she door , have trigger a anxiety attack that send she to the hospital the next day .
Taylor Ostergaard , then 17 , and Lindsey Jo Zellitte , 18 , pay the judgment on Thursday after a small claim court ruling by La Plata County Court Judge Doug Walker , a court clerk say on Friday .
the girl baked cookie as a surprise for several of they rural Colorado neighbor on July 31 and drop off small batch on they porch , accompany by red or pink paper heart and the message : `` have a great night . ''
the Denver Post newspaper report on Friday that the girl have decide to stay home and bake the cookie rather than go to a dance where there might be cursing and drinking .
Zebra Report have a picture of the good-intentioned girl .
maybe delinquency do pay off better .
Scott 2005-02-08T11:42:00 in a recent blog post Michelle Malkin mention the `` abortion jewelry '' market by the lovely feminist of `` unf * cked p * ssy , '' Joanna Rytel .
not that I be surprised - consider not long ago we be introduce to a people who proudly don the `` I have a abortion '' slogan with great pride on they t-shirt .
the first trackback entry be from the typical anti-christian variety : Ms. Rytel be absolutely correct , the anti-abortion christian have manage to convice -lrb- sic -rrb- nearly everyone that abortion be wrong and people should feel horribly guilty over it .
like we have not hear this rant before .
yes , only the christian value life when it be a life before birth .
of course it would be wrong to make people feel `` horribly guilty '' over abortion , but celebrate the skull-cracking procedure `` for the sake of the child '' in the form of t-shirt and jewelry be to be admire .
the problem for the pro-abortion movement be that hardly anyone be take a stand to reverse this societal brainwashing .
even by call the movement `` pro-choice '' instead of `` pro-abortion , '' it give credence to the christian loony .
here be where I agree with my fellow Libertarian .
`` pro-choice '' be a soft and weak label for what those people really truly represent .
I prefer pro-murder , anti-life or anti-responsibility as a suitable replacement .
Scott 2005-02-13T21:23:00 from the Associated Press : A lone gunman open fire with a assault rifle Sunday inside a crowded mall in upstate New York , wound one person before run out of ammunition and be subdue by employee , authority say .
the gunman begin shoot inside the Hudson Valley mall shortly after 3 p.m. in Kingston , nearly 90 mile north of New York City .
the 24-year-old gunman go into a best buy store and start firing .
when he run out of ammunition , he be capture by mall employee , police say .
Ulster Town Supervisor Fred Wadnola identify the gunman 's weapon as a AK-47 assault rifle .
`` everyone be run and scream .
then I hear the shot , '' witness Heather Craig tell Fox News .
whoa !
you be tell I someone be able to take a AK-47 `` assault rifle '' into a mall and injure people ?!
but it be New York .
they have gun law !
and because New York have such strict gun law - mean citizen be prohibit from conceal weapon - a gunner can use bag-toting shopper as target practice because gun law keep mall shopper at he mercy .
have a armed civilian be inside the mall , perhaps he could have intervene before the suspect begin injure people before he run out of ammo .
but not in New York .
because there people like I who have never have so much as a traffic ticket in life can not conceal weapon , unlike in Florida , where you walk past we everyday without even know it .
Scott 2005-02-24T12:07:00 from the St. Pete Times : some Florida legislator want to give people the right to shoot a attacker in a public place .
a House committee vote Wednesday to allow people to shoot to kill in self-defense if they be attack `` in any other place where he or she have a right to be . ''
sponsor by Rep. Dennis Baxley , a Ocala Republican , the bill -lrb- hb 249 -rrb- pass 13-0 .
State law define deadly force as that which be likely to cause `` death or great bodily harm , '' such as firing a gun at a person or a vehicle .
Florida court consider deadly force a last resort and have hold that a person be attack have the `` duty to use every reasonable means to avoid the danger , include retreat , prior to use deadly force . ''
but this legislation say a person who be under attack in a public place `` have no duty to retreat . ''
`` law-abiding people should not be tell that if they be attack , they should turn around and run , '' NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer tell lawmaker .
`` this bill give back rights that have be erode and take away by a judicial system that at time appear to give preferential treatment to criminal . ''
Baxley hold up a stack of more than 800 e-mail from Floridians who he say have write he to support the bill .
he say 62 House member , a majority , have endorse he bill , and supporter include Attorney General Charlie Crist and group represent Florida sheriff , police chief and police officer .
Rep. Jeff Kottkamp , R-Cape Coral , say the bill remind he of a sign he see on a constituent 's house while campaigning door-to-door .
Kottkamp say the sign , next to a doorbell , show a smoking .44 - magnum handgun and the word : `` we do not dial 911 . ''
this be great news for Florida gun carrier because now to defend yourself you do not have to first make sure a `` duty to retreat '' be impossible .
currently , if one 's life be threaten he/she must make sure it be impossible to escape before use deadly force on a attacker .
Scott 2005-02-24T22:52:00 164 day after the expiration of the federal `` assault weapon '' ban some lunatic open fire with a AK-47 outside a Texas courthouse .
a brave civilian with a conceal weapon permit try to stop he but be gun down by David Hernandez Arroyo Sr , the scumbag who happen to be wear body armor at the time and who also take out he ex-wife over a child support dispute .
nice .
I would not be surprise if this Arroyo character -lrb- who be kill by police as he try to flee -rrb- have a serious criminal past but have be allow to walk free due to we lax judicial process .
should this be a call for more gun control ?
absolutely not .
this case tell we two thing : that conceal weapon permit holder respond faster than police because we be in greater number , and that criminal wear body armor too - so it be ridiculous to claim that we should outlaw gun that be `` too powerful '' for civilian use .
perhaps someone with a five-seven -lrb- the gun the Brady Campaign call the `` cop-killer '' and be try to ban -rrb- could have be more effective at stop the armor-wearing gunner .
God bless you , Mark Wilson , 52 , a true patriot who die today try to stop this despicable maniac .
Jim Bacon 2005-01-23T16:39:00 speak of major campaign contributor , here be the most interesting story to be cull from the Virginia Public access project .
the single largest political donor in the second half of 2004 be Sheila C. Johnson , of the Plains , who make five contribution total $ 320,490 .
-lrb- see cpap profile . -rrb-
what be so special about Sheila Johnson ?
not only be she develop the Salamander Inn & Spa in Fauquier County , and not only be she a major philanthropist , but she be a co-founder of of Black Entertainment Television with she ex-husband Robert L. Johnson .
if you have not figure it out yet , she be a african-american .
I know that do not fit the dominant , minorities-are-still-disenfranchised narrative of the mainstream media .
but the Old Dominion have come a long way , in my humble opinion , when the biggest campaign contributor in the state be african American .
you know we have come along way when African Americans be not just win elect office , as former Gov. Douglas Wilder do , but they be bankroll candidate for office -- white candidate for office .
Johnson 's donation last year include $ 287,490 for domocratic gubernatorial hopeful Tim Kaine .
will Vehrs 2005-01-25T11:08:00 Jim , you be not the only one mine the datum on political contribution .

t12 :33:00 just want to add this to the discussion - I recently receive this press release from the Werkheiser campaign in NOVA - might this be the ONLY COMPETITIVE RACE THIS year ?!??!
pathetic ...

Werkheiser out-raise he opponent by almost 2 to 1 : Werkheiser $ 81,615 ; Albo $ 55,119 .
Werkheiser now have twice as much unencumbered cash on hand as he opponent : Werkheiser $ 50,017 ; Albo $ 23,767 Werkheiser 's contribution come from 200 individual ; Albo have 8 individual contributor .
Werkheiser lead all challenger statewide in total contribution raise and fund on-hand .
the 42nd House of Delegates District form the southern tip of Fairfax County .
nearly fifty-two percent of the district vote for John Kerry in 2004 , and Governor Mark Warner win the district with similar margin in 2001 .
`` I be humble by the support of so many citizen in the 42nd District who be vote with they pocketbook for a change in leadership .

will Vehrs 2005-01-27T10:17:00 The Augusta Free Press -lrb- motto : `` we only agenda be the truth '' -rrb- have a Chris Graham story on a Del. .
Chap Peterson , D-Fairfax , bill that would require payback by company lure to Virginia by incentive if they do not stay for five year .
the text of hb2898 be here .
Peterson , of course , be a candidate for the Lt. Governor nomination .
Graham 's article have the interesting hook of quote one of Peterson 's rival , former Congresswoman and State Sen. Leslie Byrne , as approve of the measure because it be `` something that I have be talk about for some time now . ''
the Virginia Economic Developers Association have not take a stance on the bill , but the organization 's leadership be expect to meet tomorrow to discuss it .
demand accountability from economic development be a rare phenomenon .
I would expect they to oppose it .
if anybody would like to debate the merit of this proposal or discuss economic development in general , the comment section be open .
PS one of we Bacons Rebellion contributor , Steven Sisson , offer this testimonial : `` without a doubt , the Augusta Free Press be the best thing since slice bread ! ''
hey , what be this blog , chop liver ?
Jim Bacon ????
- ??
- ??
t12 :26:00 if I recall correctly , the last time that Virginia seriously address the `` incentive '' issue be during the Allen administration .
the idea then be to peg incentive to performance : if the tout job and investment do not materialize , you lose the tax break and incentive .
by demand accountability , Peterson 's bill be in the spirit of Virginia 's exist policy , think perhaps somewhat tougher .
Steven Sisson ????
- ??
- ??
t18 :02:00 Will Verhrs write : `` hey , what be this blog , chop liver ? ''
I be not a certifiable Blogophile yet .
in my estimation , the Bacon 's Rebellion blog be nothing more than `` Bacon Bits '' but do not blog I wrong , because I love bacon bit on salad .
the same might be say of Chap 's condiment-packaged business bill .
Delegate Chap Petersen bill be nothing more than salt and pepper electioneering in the 2005 statewide campaign -- and be probably tie into the democratic outsourcing clamor and grow threat of more manufacturing plant close , which John Kerry politically contrived and sensationalize for the 04 presidential run .
resident throughout the commonwealth of Virginia and the rest of the nation be economically vulnerable due to free trade agreement and the global economy .
but both party be responsible and have vote in favor of those agreement .
Lt. Governor candidate 's Chap Peterson and Leslie Byrne be both good politician , but need to start think outside the box with legislation that will attract and benefit economic growth for the business world and create sustainable workplace for Virginians .
Will , I agree with you analysis , the VA business community along with a majority of ga member will probably deep-six this 5-year mandatory requirement for compensation due to relocation .
if not border on the political ridorkulous -lrb- ridiculously dorky -rrb- , it be just plain ludicrous to believe business owner would agree to a capital investment with string attach to the business health and longevity .
reward-to-punishment-to-reward maybe good dog training technique , but it be not very business friendly .
the Commonwealth need legislation that require a mandatory Employee Stock Ownership Plan -lrb- ESOP -rrb- within the contractual economic development agreement .
the ESOP be itself a corporate finance vehicle that provide monetary incentive with lending institutes , state and federal tax benefit , new capital investment , and most of all , the stock ownership plan increase VA employee capital wealth .
more capital wealth will drive we consumer-base economy through the flip roof .
but most importantly , how many Virginia business will choose to relocate -- or outsource when employee be the corporate stockowner ?
and let say the business have no other choice but to remove to the third world ... when Virginia 's employee be fully vest in company stock , they will also reap from the profit of lower wages in the global marketplace just like the corporate big boy .
it be Win-Win -- sort of .
Phil Rodokanakis ????

t19 :33:00 Steve Sisson say : `` Lt. Governor candidate 's Chap Peterson and Leslie Byrne be both good politician ... '' define what make a `` good politician ! ''
if one define be on the extreme liberal fringe of the Democart party as good , than Byrne surely qualify under that label .
Peterson be slightly to the right of Byrne , but not by much ... frankly , I do not consider tax and spend liberal as good politician .
unfortunately , the Republican Party be also load with its share of irresponsible big spender , but hopefully some of they will be hold accountable during the 2005 primary election .
on the other hand , I have yet to see any Democrats challenge incumbent for be fiscally irresponsible .

Barnie Day 2005-02-04T13:26:00 Renowned UVA political scientist Larry Sabato this morning announce a $ 1,000,000 cash gift to the University of Virginia .

Sabato have write 23 book .

t20 :45:00 that be pretty darn generous .
be it he money ?

t20 :45:00 I be not ashamed to say that I be in the tank for Professor Sabato .
he maintain he political independence as well as any pundit and this donation affirm that the word he be always use to describe he commitment to UVA be genuine .
he could have move on to any number of tv or print opportunity , but have stay in Charlottesville to continue he good work .
I would suggest Wahoos disenchanted with Pete Gillen rally around Sabato as the embodiment of they university 's excellence .
will Vehrs 2005-02-05T19:19:00 with no web presence , publication like the Richmond Free Press be rarely acknowledge in the blogosphere .
the rfp serve the african-american community in the city of Richmond .
in the latest edition , staff writer Jeremy M. Lazarus report that the legislative black Caucus celebrate kill a bill that would have merge the Department of Minority Business Enterprise -lrb- DMBE -rrb- with the Department of Business Assistance -lrb- DBA -rrb- .
Del. .
Dwight Jones -lrb- D-Richmond -rrb- , chair of the caucus , say kill the bill have be they `` main objective '' in a effort to , accord to Lazarus , `` promote economic justice for black business . ''
I believe any neutral management consultant worth he or she salt would recommend a merger of the two organization .
there be considerable duplication of effort and DBA be strong in one area -- financial control -- where DMBE have consistently have problem .
there would be service benefit to business client , too .
nonetheless , the symbolism of have they `` own '' agency and support from Governor Warner for maintain DMBE 's `` independence '' apparently overcome any efficiency and service argument .
another article , this one by staff writer Skeeter Faulk , describe Sen. George Allen 's commitment to name the new Federal courthouse in downtown Richmond for Spottswood W. Robinson III , a note NAACP lawyer and federal judge .
Robinson work with Thurgood Marshall on Brown v. Board of Education .
Faulk find the nomination a `` surprise '' in light of Allen 's past , when he `` embrace and glorify the confederate flag and its sympathizer . ''
Faulk chalk the name up to Allen 's presidential ambition .
it be tough to be a republican when it come to the african-american community .
do nothing and you confirm they worst suspicion ; do something and it arouse a different kind of suspicion .
Jim Bacon ????
- ??
- ??
t17 :26:00 Will , I share you frustration at the reaction to Allen 's nod to Spottswood Robins .
among some segment of the african-american community , it be indeed a matter of damned-if-you-do , damned-if-you-don ` t .
but you could say the same thing of the Democratic Party as a whole .
I think it be important to recognize that african Americans , though still overwhelmingly democratic , comprise less of a monolith than they do 20-30 year ago .
I find myself continually amaze at how open-minded many young African-Americans be .
and I think that open-mindedness go a long way to explain the desperate effort of many -lrb- not all , but many -rrb- within the Democratic Party to circle the wagon with the cry of `` racism , racism , racism '' when the evidence of racism be increasingly a stretch .
it be like how , after the civil war , Republicans `` wave the bloody shirt '' , associate the Democratic Party with the secession and , ultimately , the war itself .
eventually , that tactic lose its power .
and so , too , will the cry of racism , racism .
Scott ????
- ??

t11 :15:00 agree .
more importantly , the lack of disclosure be frightening .
Media General/Times Dispatch , Richmond.com , and the Richmond Free Press all have significant tie to the vpaf 's propose Virginia perform art Center , yet we do not see anything resemble balanced coverage of the controversy and debate surround this issue .

no oppose view .
... this be not just liberal , but dumb liberal -- npr could easily have find a Democrat , maybe even a old Democrat , who believe cdbg be a ineffective antipoverty program .
-lrb- basically they be slush fund for local politician , who too often sluice the federal money to they developer friend to build ugly downtown hotel . -rrb-
it be my sense that in Virginia , the CDBG program be use extensively in rural area and , on the whole , have do some good .
maybe someone know of CDBG fund use in Virginia as Mickey describe .
I hope not , but , if so , it look like there will not be as much of that in the future .
Jim Bacon 2005-02-14t09:44:00 by Steven Sisson Choir boy Tim Kaine be a political moderate inform by he catholic belief .
but look for the Kilgore team to paint he as a liberal for he record on tax hike and the death penalty .
the Blue Dog personally view Lt. Gov. Tim Kaine as a moderate-to-conservative politician .
Kaine have never be a Amway Christian , nor do he hold a lifetime membership to the C-E Club -lrb- i.e. , only attend church service on Christmas and Easter holiday -rrb- .
more anonymous ????

t07 :49:00 Kaine a `` moderate to conservative '' ?

Kaine be as liberal as they come .
who other than a left-wing liberal would agree to represent a two-time murderer -lrb- Lem Tugle -rrb- for free , to try and keep he from get the death penalty .
Tugle be on trial for rape and kill a southwest Virginia grandmother .
after kill she , he dump she body down the same ditch where he dump the 17-year-old girl he have previously be convict of murder .
Tugle be on parole for this crime when he kill the grandmother .
I understand that represent people be what attorney do but even attorney have some choice in whom they represent .
the line of defense Kaine use be that Tugle have not really rape the grandmother because `` forcable sodomy be not rape accord to the law at the time . ''

t09 :01:00 hand in hand with any consideration of the redistricting process , we shoul give some think to the structural relationship between the state House and Senate .
currently , each House member represent approximately 75,000 Virginians , while each Senator represent appoximately 187,500 .
often as not , there be no rational commonality between the two .
some senator represent people pool that be in turn fracture into five or six House district .
I believe this account , in large part , for the dysfunction that characterize we state government now .
former governor Gerald Baliles , in this same vein , have advocate a realignment of the two house in a way that serve commonality .
he have suggest that we either increase membership in the Senate to 50 , or decrease House membership to 80 , produce a scenario wherein 1 Senator would represent a block of people who be represent by exactly 2 Delegates .
he think -- and I think he be right -- that this arrangement would foster a closer working relationship between the Senate and the House .
you certainly would not have these dysfunctional grouping we now have , where 1 Senator often represent a population divide among half a dozen Delegates of two party -- three , if you count independent .

will Vehrs 2005-02-18T12:14:00 Virginia be apparently go to be build a datum center in Richmond , a back-up datum center , and a help desk/call center as a follow-on to the creation of VITA , the Virginia Information Technology Agency .
the Bristol Herald Courier editorial page be urge that the back-up center be build in Wise County to take advantage of uva-wise .
SCHEV , of course , tell the General Assembly that UVA-Wise do not generate any economic development , so a new university in Southside would not , either .
the Courier say Wise should get the center over Danville because there be no southside university .
no other candidate location be identify .
I believe that any new state-wide service facility should be locate in either Southside or Southwest .
if we can tie up all state procurement official and all vendor in a quest to help under-represented small , minority , and woman-owned business , we should commit all new state facility spending in a quest to help we economically disadvantaged region .

Adam Ebbin -lrb- D , Alexandria -rrb- be the first openly gay member to serve in the House of Delegates .
there be a brief profile of ebbin by Kristen Gelineau in today 's Daily Press .
what I find interesting be the contrast in reaction to ebbin from two colleague : `` I suppose that one of the concern be that since he be the only openly gay member of the Legislature , be whether or not that would be the only issue that he would ... talk about , '' say Del. .
Ward Armstrong , D-Henry County .
`` that clearly have not be the case .
he be a very versatile delegate . ''
Del. .
Richard Black , R-Loudoun , who have compile a track record as one of the most socially conservative member of the state legislature and be the sponsor of the gay adoption bill , say he be not try to stamp out gay rights but be simply try to preserve tradition .
as for he personal feeling on Ebbin , after a lengthy pause , the Loudoun Republican offer : `` he be always prompt and , you know , on time to meeting . ''
a moment later , he add , `` I think he work hard . ''
I think it be possible to support some of Black 's position but still be very disappoint by he cold assessment of a colleague .

I would much rather someone call I `` prompt '' and `` hard-working '' than `` very versatile . ''

these problem multiply when the New England chain stop n ' Shop acquire Giant .

it be a cautionary tale for business and for any long-standing organization seek to change .

most of the new store compete with giant be in Virginia .

will Vehrs 2005-02-26T13:17:00 a old friend , Joseph Britt of Kennesaw , GA , recently email to ask about anti-immigration as a issue for Virginia Democrats .
Joe have just read a George W. Grayson article in the William & Mary Alumni Magazine , '' Myths about Illegal Immigration . ''
Grayson do not cite any Virginia example , but among the `` myth '' he attempt to explode be that illegal immigrant perform job american do not want and that they contribute more in tax and social security than they take from government program .
Jim Bacon ????
- ??

t11 :25:00 I personally know a good number of immigrant , both legal and illegal .
one fellow , a brazilian , have do everything by the book .
he get reward by have to pay a immigration attorney thousand of dollar while get yank around by the Immigration Service ... not to mention , he be pay the government thousand in tax .
he get very frustrated because many of he contemporary work for cash under the table .
they be not pay lawyer , and they pay nothing into the system .
of course , the Americans who employ illegal immigrant be happy to pay in cash because it mean cheaper labor for they .
who benefit ?
the illegal immigrant themselves , of course .
the employer who hire they instead of raise wages to attract native-born Americans and legal immigrant .
and family who hire cheap domestic labor , whether to clean the house , wash the laundry or maintain the lawn .
who lose ?
Poor , native-born Americans who otherwise would be pay higher wages for they manual labor .
legal immigrant like my brazilian friend , who sometimes feel like a sap for play by the rule .
and the rest of we who will not hire anyone to work for we unless they be pay they tax , even if it mean we pay more .
yeah , I have get a problem with turn around and give illegal immigrant all the rights and privilege of the native bear and the legal immigrant who have play by the rule .
yes , I do .
will Vehrs 2005-02-27T12:38:00 Governor Mark Warner have turn state government upside-down in a effort to do more business with small , woman , and minority own -lrb- swam -rrb- firm and the thanks he get be headline like this one in the Daily Press : Warner 's plan to raise contracting diversity fall short .
the article be full of innuendo that procurement offical be ignore the governor 's wish and just wait for he to leave office , that `` special deal '' be cut with non-swam vendor , and that somehow the electronic procurement system be `` stack '' against SWAM firm .
if true , these be serious charge , worthy of high-level investigation .
what be miss from the article , though , be any attempt at investigative journalism to give even one factual example support the innuendo .
what be also miss be a fair-minded review of whether the sag number report for SWAM procurement be valid .
Someday a journalist be go to take the time to watch a sample number of swam firm submit bid on openly post contract , then use procurement tool that be in place to determine if any swam firm be unfairly deny contract they deserve .
until then , this carping appear to be sour grape .
Governor Warner have do plenty to open up the system to swam firm and give they a presumptive advantage , even invite a backlash by non-swam firm .
maybe swam firm be not do all they can to return the governor 's faith in they .

Curt 2004-11-13T15:28:00 welcome all to my new site .
I have decide to incorporate my old work blog into a general blog , the work diary be up on the right title `` my work diary '' .
EFF YEAH !
BUSH win !
ok then .
my next thought .
the world be a much better place now that the terrorist Yassar Arafat be dead .
here be a good one minute video on he great legacy here .
this guy be one of the early innovator of terrorism in this century and he be protray by the Main Stream Media -lrb- MSM for short -rrb- as a `` freedom fighter '' .
because of he million of palestinian choose `` jihad '' over peace with Isreal .
he innovate suicide bomber and plane hijacking plus he embezzell hundred of million of dollar from aid fund ... and this guy get a nobel peace prize , what a disgrace .
update 1 - Drudge be report that Arafat have be skim 2 million a month from the gasoline trade in the territory mag : Arafat Skimmed $ 2 Million a Month from the Gas Trade Sun Nov 14 2004 09:53:40 ETNew York -- last year auditor discover Arafat be guilty of skim $ 2 million a month from the gasoline trade in the territory , time reports.in August 2002 international donor force Arafat to sign over he investment to the Palestine Investment Fund , which be audit by U.S. accountant and manage by palestinian Finance Minister Salam Fayyad , a former International Monetary Fund official .
after scour corporation throughout the Arab world and bank account in the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg , the auditor identify $ 800 million , which have be make a part of the palestinian Authority 's official budget .
it be the most successful financial reform in the Arab world , -- Jim Prince , president of the Los angeles-based Democracy Council and head of the audit team , tell TIME .
people close to Fayyad 's investigation tell time of Arafat 's skim from the gas trade .
break the gasoline smuggling and corruption boost the palestinian Authority 's official treasury by $ 10 million a month and cut gas price for ordinary Palestinians .
`` Arafat 's death mean he follower may never know just how much more they may be owe , `` write TIME 's Matt Rees in `` where 's Arafat 's money ? ''
in the mid-1990 , Arafat control a financial empire worth at least $ 3 billion .
by the time of he death , he be down to he last $ 1 billion , accord to israeli-intelligence estimates.arafat wife Suha 's outburst that he successor be `` try to bury -lsb- he -rsb- alive '' come after she learn that Arafat have sign over at least $ 800 million to the government of the palestinian Authority two year ago , time report .
top palestinian official say Suha want the new chief of the P.L.O. , Mahmoud Abbas , and palestinian prime minister Ahmed Qurei to give she money out of the P.L.O. 's party coffer .
but a senior P.L.O. official tell TIME , `` they will pay she a pension , and that be it . ''
people familiar with Arafat 's finances say the palestinian leader send Suha $ 200,000 a month out of the palestinian Authority 's budget for the Office of the President .
french authority be investigate transfer of $ 15 million from swiss bank to Paris account in Suha 's name at the Arab Bank and at BNP Paribas Bank , a french bank , time reports.senior palestinian security official tell time that Arafat also ship money to the gunman of the Aqsa Martyrs Brigades .
develop ... sure sound like a Nobel Prize winner to I .
Curt 2004-11-14T12:40:00 Time be report today that a al-Qaeda operative be capture and be spit out that they have plan in the work to smuggle nuke into the US from Mexico , see the article here .
thank god Bush be still we president , although I strongly disagree with he on he new immigration policy .
this policy would just make it easier for the enemy to get within we border .
Curt 2004-11-15T16:13:00 just report from ap that Condi Rice have be choose by President Bush to become the new Secretary of State for he second term .
I agree with he choice and think she will make a much better Secretary then Powell do .
she view be much more in step with the President then Powell , although he be a true soldier and carry the message .
plus , any lady who work out to Led Zeppelin and be a football nut be alright in my book .
Curt 2004-11-16T08:33:00 thanks to Captain Ed for bring this up .
apparently James Baker , former Secretary of State and current envoy for the Bush Administration , have ask the isreali government to release a scumbag terrorist to promote `` peace '' .
there be now ... .
in a israeli prison a man name Marwan Barghouti , who be one of the young guard of Palestinians , and if the Palestinians be go to make this work against the really hard-line element , the Islamists and some of the people of Hamas , they be go to have to have a coalition of the young guard and the old guard . ''
Got ta say that this shocked I , I have always think Mr. Baker be a upstand guy but this be just plain good old fashion bullcrap .
here be some of the fine achievement of the terrorist Marwan Barghouti Marwan Barghouti -lrb- bear June 6 , 1958 -rrb- be a palestinian leader from the West Bank and a leader of the Fatah movement that form the backbone of the palestinian Authority and the Palestine Liberation Organization -lrb- PLO -rrb- .
on June 6 , 2004 , he be sentence to five life sentence for five murder of israeli civilian and 40 year imprisonment for attempt murder in terrorist attack against israeli civilian .
Barghouti be one of the major leader of the First Intifada in 1987 , lead Palestinians in a mass uprising against israeli occupation of the West Bank .
during the uprising , he be arrest by Israel and deport to Jordan , where he stay for seven year until he be permit to return under the term of the Oslo Accords in 1994 .
in 1996 , he be elect to the palestinian legislative Council , in which he advocate peace with Israel , sometimes come in conflict with Yasser Arafat .
the formal position occupy by Barghouti be the General Secretary of Fatah in the West Bank .
by the summer of 2000 , Barghouti and Arafat have grow increasingly at odds with each other , with Barghouti accuse Arafat 's administration of corruption and he security service of human rights violation , and Arafat be plan to fire he shortly .
however , as the second intifada begin , Barghouti become increasingly popular as a leader of the Fatah Tanzim militia .
this be perhaps due to the transformation of Tanzim into a organization more resemble militant group like Hamas and Islamic Jihad , responsible for dozen of civilian death in drive-by shooting .
under Barghouti , the Tanzim have also carry out suicide bombing in Israel under the name al-aqsa martyr ' brigade .
what be he think ?
release a known terrorist to run the PLO and that will bring about peace , give I a effin break
Curt 2004-11-17T20:02:00 Chris Matthews , that idiot talk head over at MSNBC , say yesterday about the terrorist we fight in Fallujah `` a rival , I mean they be not bad guy especially , just people who just disagree with we '' ... this just amaze I , the complete idiocy of this waste of human sperm .
these be the same terrorist blow up family , chop off head of civilian , and the complete disregard for any human life and they just disagree with we ?
tell that to the family of Margaret Hassan , the school teacher who be brutally tortured and then slaughter by these same guy , they be not so bad be they Chris Matthews ?
this woman who be know for she 30 year of work in Iraq , distribute medicine , food and supplies to Iraqis suffer under the sanction of the 1990s .
british official say they believe Hassan be a blindfold woman see be shoot in the head by a hooded militant on a video obtain but not air by the Arab television station Al-Jazeera .
she would be the first foreign woman to die in the wave of kidnapping in Iraq .
no group have claim responsibility .
on Sunday , Marines find the mutilate body of what they believe be a western woman on a street in Fallujah during the U.S. assault on the insurgent stronghold .
the body , clothe in what appear to be a purple , velour dress , be wrap in a blanket , with a blood-soaked black cloth nearby .
as of Tuesday night , the U.S. command say the body have not be identify .
these be the reason that none of these mothereffer should ever see the light of day ... they need to be all line up and shot .
torture this poor woman for what ?
what ?
and we should treat they as enemy soldier under the Geneva Convention .
last I remember the convention apply to country that sign the document and the two country must have stand army with uniform ... the iraqi military be at we side , the terrorist be not .
since when be terrorist soldier ?
they be lower then dog .
finally there be this write by a student of Mrs. Hassan she be my English teacher in the memory of my teacher and a fellow aid worker colleague Mrs. M. Hassan Mrs. Hassan be my English teacher in the british Council in Baghdad in Al-Wazirya district , I remember she year ago with she irish accent tell I it be not important how many word I must learn but the pronunciation of the word I already know must be perfect .
Mrs. Hassan speak s perfect arabic and she have a heart of gold , she be be kill by -lrb- man in pajamas -rrb- , turn Iraq upside down and find they .
the Marines will find they , and when they do they shall die .
Curt 2004-12-28T09:27:00 2Slick point I to a article at in Iraq for 365 .
this be a great blog and I encourage you all to read it regularly .
on Sunday he write of two iraqi soldier who do not see we as conqueror but as ally when the Mosul bombing occur .
the suicide bomb spray bb-like fragment throughout the Marez dining facility .
one piece of shrapnel slice through the femoral artery of a U.S. soldier and he only chance for survival be in the hand of these two Iraqis .
recall the medical class they would receive from the special force , the Iraqis react calmly , fasten a belt above the wound , create a tourniquet , which stop the gush stream of red .
they move the soldier to a medvac vehicle via two-man litter carry .
after they hoist the soldier in the truck , the two Iraqis -- one a officer , the other a NCO -- run back to the facility and begin treat the other wound without regard for they safety .
when the dust settle and the mess tent have be evacuate , everybody who could talk be question about they health .
when the medic come to the two Iraqis , the ING soldier only want to know how everybody else be .
when ask why do they do it , they simply state , `` this be we duty ; we be a team , and we take care of each other . ''
even the Americans .
no matter what the MSM try to tell you , there be iraqi 's who will help the ally , who will fight alongside they and put they life at risk to make sure democracy succeed in they country .
this bring to mind a speech Prime Minister Tony Blair give recently while visit Iraq .
when I meet the people work alongside the United Nations -- Iraqis in fear of they life every day , because they be try to bring freedom and democracy to they people -- when I see they courage and they determination and know that they speak for the vast majority of people in Iraq who want that democracy and freedom , then I know that we be do the right thing ... .
and I will also say this to you : there be people die in Iraq , but the reason people be die be because of the terrorism and the intimidation and the people who be deliberately kill anyone try to make this country better .
now what should we response be as a international community ?
we response should be to stand alongside the democrat -- the people who have get the courage to see this thing through -- and help they see it through .
I have get no doubt at all that that be the right thing for we to do ... .
sometimes when I see some of the reporting of what be happen in Iraq in the rest of the world , I just feel that people should understand how precious what have be create here be .
and those people from that electoral commission that I describe as the hero of the new Iraq -- every day ... a lot of they be not live in the Green Zone , they have get to travel in from outside .
they do not know at any point in time whether they be go to be subject to brutality or intimidation , even death , and yet they carry on do it .
now what a magnificent example of the human spirit -- that be the side we should be on .
Curt 2004-12-30T18:44:00 this recent news story be trouble in many different way .
when I first hear of the story I figure it be some wackjob playing with a new toy but now we find out there have be 7 incident since Christmas from the West to East coast .
the FBI , concern that terrorist could use laser as weapon , be investigate why laser beam be direct into the cockpit of seven airplane in flight since Christmas .
Laser beam can temporarily blind or disorient pilot and possibly cause a plane to crash .
the FBI be look into two incident in Colorado Springs , Colo. , and one each in Cleveland , Washington , Houston , Teterboro , N.J. , and Medford , Ore. , accord to federal and local law enforcement and transportation official , some of whom speak only on condition of anonymity .
a federal law enforcement official , who decline to be identify by name , say Thursday there be no evidence of a plot or terrorist activity .
but pilot be trouble by the incident , and the FBI earlier this month warn of the possibility that terrorist might use the device as weapon .
`` it be not some kid , '' say Paul Rancatore , a pilot who serve as deputy chairman of the security committee for the Allied Pilots Association .
`` it be too organize . ''
Loren Thompson , who teach military technology at Georgetown University , call it a `` rather worrisome development , '' though he say expert would be more puzzle than alarm .
`` what we be talk about be a fairly powerful visible light laser that have the ability to lock onto a fast-moving aircraft , '' Thompson say .
`` that be not the sort of thing you pick up at a military surplus store . ''
Thompson say a piece of equipment that could do the thing the FBI suspect would be `` fairly expensive and fairly sophisticated . ''
`` it sound like a organize effort to cause airline accident , '' Thompson say .
Michelle Malkin have a post about this today where some outlet have stop sell laser .
lot of people think that these indeed might be loony play with new Christmas toy but I disagree .
these be incident where the Airplanes be track , some as high as 8500 foot .
to track a fast move plane at that altitude would not be some toy you can get from the local wal-mart .
in my opinion this be quite alarming .
this be not write , it be typing have a great post out with a ton of info , some of it quite scary a more frightening scenario be that terrorist may have obtain a chinese-produced zm-87 laser blinder which be specifically design to blind eyesight .
the japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo -- which launch the infamous Sarin gas attack on the Tokyo subway system in 1995 -- be discover to have experiment with the use of laser as weapons.according to the Asian Pacific Post , `` cult member apparently obtain laser design information from russian institutes they visit and build a laser weapon mount on a truck .
they have plan to use the laser against Tokyo policemen , but the plan fail when the laser malfunction during the testing stage . ''
PoliticAlex also have some info on this story also .
I find the follow report that be present to Congress recently about the shoulder launch missle threat to airliner , which this might very well be a precursor to : recent event have focus attention on the threat that terrorist with shoulder fire surface-to-air missile -lrb- sam -rrb- , refer to as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems -lrb- MANPADS -rrb- , pose to commercial airliner .
most believe that no single solution exist to effectively mitigate this threat .
instead , a menu of option may be consider , include install infrared -lrb- ir -rrb- countermeasure on aircraft ; modify flight operation and air traffic control procedure ; improve airport and regional security ; and strengthen missile non-proliferation effort .
equip aircraft with missile countermeasure system can protect the aircraft even when operate in area where ground-based security measure be unavailable or infeasible to implement .
however , this option have a relatively high cost , between $ 1 million and $ 3 million per aircraft , and the time need for implementation do not allow for immediate response to the exist terrorist threat .
procedural improvement such as specific flight crew training , alter air traffic procedure to minimize exposure to the threat , and improve security near airport may be less costly than countermeasure and could more immediately help deter domestic terrorist attack .
however , these technique by themselves can not completely mitigate the risk of domestic attack and would not protect U.S. airliner fly to and from foreign airport .
legislation introduce in the 108th Congress -lrb- H.R. 580 , S. 311 -rrb- call for the installation of missile defense system in all turbojet aircraft use in schedule air carrier service .
while this legislation be still under consideration , Homeland Security appropriation designate $ 60 million in fy2004 and $ 61 million in fy2005 to fund a program to develop and test prototype missile countermeasure system for commercial aircraft base on exist military technology .
it be anticipate that at the conclusion of this program , in January 2006 , the Department of Homeland Security will be able to provide a detailed analysis of the suitability of such system for use to protect commercial passenger aircraft .
Curt 2005-01-01T22:44:00 American Future have a link up to a article write in yesterday Houston Chronicle .
it describe how the european government look to be change they tune in regard to President Bush .
why you ask ?
but there be arguably more to this sea change than just a grumpy acceptance of the status quo .
from a european perspective , three thing be make it easier to warm to the Bush White House .
one be the death of Yasser Arafat .
no issue divide Europe and the United States more keenly than the israeli-palestinian dispute .
for the last few year , Europeans have criticize Bush for fail to put enough pressure on Israel to get out of the occupied territory and for refuse to deal with Arafat .
that another reason why I respect Bush so much , he refusal to acknowledge that windbag terrorist Arafat .
May he rot in hell .
but since Arafat 's death , Europeans and Americans have be able to find common ground : support Ariel Sharon 's withdrawal from Gaza , put pressure on Israel to let the Palestinians hold election and , covertly , back Mahmoud Abbas to become the next palestinian leader .
a second reason be Europe 's grow worry about islamic terrorism .
the murder in November of Theo van Gogh , a provocative dutch filmmaker , at the hand of a islamic militant have be call Europe 's 9/11 .
though the two event be obviously not fully comparable , it be certainly true that american conservative , such as Francis Fukuyama and Bernard Lewis , have find a wider audience recently for the idea that radical Islam be inimical to european tradition of tolerance .
you mean those radical muslim can be kinda nasty sometimes ?
get outta here ... keep do business like the coward in Spain and they will more then likely have they very own 9/11 to cry about .
the third force be the reappearance , albeit in a milder form , of the threat that keep the trans-atlantic alliance together for half a century .
the russian bear be growl again .
the ukrainian election -- complete with its kgb-style poisoning of the opposition leader and heavy-handed electoral fraud -- have remind european diplomat of Vladimir V. Putin 's determination to control he `` near abroad . ''
they should be very worried about this item , I believe Putin be slowly slide Russia back to what it once be .
hopefully we government be not asleep at the wheel with this situation either .
there be a personal edge to all this .
just as the snooty continental eventually come to admire the gormless Hollywood actor , there be a grudging willingness to rethink some prejudice about the inarticulate texan .
many european leader once swallow the Michael Moore version of history : that Bush be a ignorant interloper who steal the White House .
he thump re-election , however , show that he represent a large body of conservative american opinion .
in short , Europeans be get use to the idea that it be not Bush who be the exception , but the U.S. itself that be exceptional -- and that if they want to deal with this exceptional superpower they need to humor it rather than rile it .
strangely enough , this have be Tony Blair 's strategy all along ; it be rapidly become the continent 's strategy , too .
could not of end that article any better myself .
get use to it France , we be not go nowhere .
Curt 2005-02-03T19:53:00 interesting article at the Accuracy in Media website yesterday .
it seem a suppose straight shooting reporter with NBC be take money to fund a book that be so pro-united nation that its almost sickening to read .
-lrb- hat tip clear and present -rrb- one of the hottest story around , the U.N. corruption scandal , NBC have be out to lunch .
why ?
its U.N. reporter have be on the payroll of the U.N. lobby .
Linda Fasulo , the U.N. correspondent for NBC News and MSNBC , have write a pro-u.n. book , a Insider 's Guide to the U.N. , which read like the U.N. pay for it .
actually , the pro-u.n. lobby pay for it .
in a monstrous conflict of interest for a suppose straight news reporter , Fasulo acknowledge Ted Turner 's U.N. Foundation and Better World Campaign for `` they generous financial support '' of she book project .
she also thanks the Rockefeller Brothers Fund `` for help to fund the project . ''
the book be about `` one of the finest and most important govern body , '' she say .
of the U.N. chief , she write like a school girl with a crush .
`` it be hard to find anyone who can mount a serious criticism of -lsb- kofi -rsb- Annan 's performance as Secretary General , '' she claim .
he performance be so `` impressive '' that she wonder if a `` cult of personality '' have rise up around he .
one U.S. official be report to be `` astonish by just how good a Secretary General Kofi Annan have be . ''
yup , you read that right .
Kofi 's performance be soooooo impressive .
gag .
guess the democrat have they own Armstrong conspiracy to deal with .
why would a NBC reporter -lrb- who also report on the U.N. for National Public Radio -rrb- take money from the U.N. lobby ?
perhaps because longtime NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw put he stamp of approval on the UNA-USA and BCUN by act as master of ceremony at they 2001 global leadership dinner .
not surprisingly , Brokaw be list on the Fasulo book jacket as say it be a `` must-read . ''
another endorsement of the book come from Barbara Crossette , former New York Times bureau chief at the U.N. who now write for U.N. Wire , a Ted turner-funded online news service that cover the U.N. .
a fascinating part of the book be how Fasulo manage to gloss over Annan 's role in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda .
she try to blame the U.S. and other member of the Security Council for not send enough troops to stop it .
she admit , however , that , `` the Rwanda massacre occur while Annan be U.N. Undersecretary General for peacekeeping , '' and that `` after he become sg -lsb- Secretary General -rsb- , Annan commission a report to examine what have happen and suggest remedy . ''
later , `` Annan accept responsibility for fail to act more quickly , '' she write .
but responsibility for what ?
the truth be that , as director of U.N. peacekeeping , Annan personally refuse request to authorize U.N. peacekeeper in Rwanda to seize weapon and prevent genocide .
writer and author Philip Gourevitch have describe in detail how , three month before the genocide , Major General Romeo Dallaire , the commander of several thousand U.N. troops in Rwanda , send a fax to Kofi Annan 's office , say he have receive evidence from a rwandan government informant that genocide be be plan .
the informant offer to help U.N. force in raiding the government stockpile to be use in the genocide campaign .
all that the informant want in return be protection for himself and he family .
but the general needed U.N. authorization to conduct such a raid and save life .
he ask for that approval but the answer come back in a now-infamous `` genocide fax '' from Annan 's office .
it deny authorization for the mission and tell he that he should turn the information provide by the confidential witness over to the rwandan government which be plan the genocide !
the result be that the information dry up and the genocide take place .
yup , good ole Kofi tell this poor guy to give the secret info over to the very government that be plan the genocide .
what a great guy he be be not he .
or how about the ongoing prostitution that be go on in the Congo ?
now the report come out today on the oil for Food scandal .
yeah ... this guy be such a good sg .
Eff he .
the article end with the following : in a April 30 , 2001 , Washington Times column , Nat Hentoff note that the media have devote `` scant mention '' to the `` plain fact that it be Mr. Annan , when he be head of the United Nation 's peacekeep office , who could have prevent the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and they sympathizer in Rwanda in 1994 . ''
it be true , Hentoff say , that the U.N. issue a report in 1999 that acknowledge , to some extent , its role in the killing .
but for five and a half year , he note , Annan `` refuse to accept any responsibility for the rwandan holocaust until Mr. Gourevitch and other reveal that less than 5,000 U.N. troops could have stop the killing if Mr. Annan have not close he eye . ''
it be astonishing that a journalist for NBC New would close she eye to Annan 's role .
but that be what she be apparently pay to do .
Curt 2005-02-17T12:37:00 get ta hate the french , I really do not think there be anything good you can say about the french anymore , they be a waste and a joke of a government .
apparently Bush want the European 's to classify Hezbollah as a terrorist group .
make sense right ?
as rise instability in Lebanon increase tension in the Middle East , the Bush administration be argue with european government over whether they should designate the lebanon-based shiite group Hezbollah a terrorist organization , american and european official say .
the United States be already step up pressure on Iran and Syria , Hezbollah 's main sponsor .
the american rift with Syria deepen this week , with suspicion that Syria might have be behind the assassination of Lebanon 's former prime minister in Beirut on Monday .
... in the past two week , the official say , France have rebuff appeal by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and the israeli foreign minister , Silvan shalom , to list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization , which would prevent it from raise money in Europe through charity group .
the United States have long call Hezbollah a terrorist organization , but the french , american and european official say , have oppose do so , and argue that make such a designation now would be unwise , give the new turbulence in Lebanon .
israeli and american official say that the palestinian president , Mahmoud Abbas , have tell they that he , too , regard Hezbollah as a destructive force in the Middle East , one determine to undermine peace talk by support militant group that attack Israelis .
Got ta love that .
the palestinian president admit that Hezbollah be a bunch of f-wad terrorist but the French do not agree ... no joke .
the Europeans be not solidly oppose to list Hezbollah as a terrorist group , the official say .
the Netherlands , Italy and Poland support the Bush administration 's view , several official say , while Germany and Britain believe the issue be moot unless the french change they mind .
one european diplomat say other country be `` hide behind '' France on the issue .
... a european diplomat say the issue of call Hezbollah a terrorist organization be discuss in Brussels on Wednesday at a meeting of the Clearing House , a unit of the European Union that meet in confidential session to review terrorist activity in Europe .
the group could reach no consensus , the diplomat say .
`` nothing be go to change on Hezbollah because we do not have a agreement among the member state , '' the diplomat say .
`` that do not mean we will not get a consensus .
I know the Americans be impatient , but the European Union have 25 state , and these thing take time . ''
some of those interview try to make it sound as if the reason they be hesitant to go along with Bush be because of the situation in Lebanon .
but as the Captain point out , it probably have more to do with Iran : I suspect the true reason for the reluctance come not from the `` delicate '' nature of lebanese politics , but from the relationship between Hezbollah and the Iranians .
the EU have try for the past two year to appease the iranian mulla into give up they nuclear-weapons ambition to little avail .
they do not want to rock the boat now by attempt to starve out the mulla ' terror agent that conduct the proxy attack against Israel that Iran can not afford to do itself openly .
they do not learn from Hitler 's Germany I guess , they try to appease that guy too .
this whole thing just remind I how corrupt and useless France be .
they will forever be know as that corrupt and coward in my opinion .
Read from On High , Dhimmi Watch , Cranky Neocon , and my View of the world for more .
Nicolae Mischie , authoritarian leader of a district organization of the main opposition party , have be jail .
Romania vote in the last December , oust the so-called socialist party psd -lrb- Social-Democratic Party -rrb- .
psd manage to keep a stronghold in poor rural area , with the help of people like Mischie .
they combine blackmail , use they right of decision regard the public fund for local leader oppose PSD , and strong seduction of the uneducated mass , in a marvelous way .
E.g. , Mischie , who talk like a idiot , get a phd in history .
he paper be on a political personality of the 19th century and Mischie buy the house where he paper 's subject live .
maybe he try to invest in he paper , maybe he believe sincerely in he admiration for the poor innocent dead guy and he ability of earn phd , but use a big car and living in a big house be sign for the mass that the man be a invaluable and irreplaceable leader .
another misleading sign be he position as a University professor - he be teach mostly at private university , which be still way to buy diploma here in Romania .
local leader do they job , but national leader , pressure tv station to lie , associate with old communist ex-president Ion Iliescu , fail to win in big city .
psd be build a strategy for the 4 year to come and they be go to elect a leader .
it be know that communist leader die in office -lrb- as judge of the U.S. Supreme Court -rrb- and Ion Iliescu will not be different .
all the leader that express different point of view will be exclude from the party , that be the untold truth that romanian media seem to hide or not conceive yet .
Mischie be right to criticize the national leader , because PSD get a good share in the election in he area .
but Mischie be wrong , because he do that while in vacation in Switzerland , where you can not go if you earn 20k $ a year .
the new power have nothing to do , but let the policeman do what they should be do year ago .
iliescu and nastase , ex-president and ex-prime minister , be now leave only with the leadership of the party and hold this illusory authority .
if Mischie would not take he chance on they , he would still be free , with the help of the weak and weaken string Iliescu might still pull .
zeyad 2004-11-08t19:42:06 the interim government declare a state of emergency in Iraq exclude the kurdish region for 60 day , accord to the National Security Law introduce last August which state that emergency law can be declare in the country for a period no more than 60 day provide a serious threat against iraqi national security be recognise by the interim government .
obviously , this be a necessary step that should have be take at least two month ago .
suicide bombing and guerrilla attack carry out by insurgent and foreign terrorist base around Baghdad have escalate to alarming level particularly during Ramadan .
Deputy governor of Diyala along with several council member from Ba ` quba be ambush and kill in Latifiya south of Baghdad , a area which have supposedly be ` clear ' from insurgent a couple of week ago .
four suicide attack in Samarra , also a recently ` liberate ' area , against National Guard unit and the governorate building .
Zarqawi 's group claim responsibility for the attack .
three police station in Haditha , a small town west of Ramadi , be assault by group of insurgent .
some 30 policeman be capture , tie up and execute in cold blood against the wall follow a confrontation which last two hour .
Zarqawi 's group , again , claim responsibility .
a full-scale military operation against Fallujah , which be apparently underway already , seem to be the government 's ` final solution ' .
I be not optimistic to the outcome , especially when significant civilian casualty be unavoidable .
note , that I be not suggest a peaceful or political solution would work either in these area .
insurgent west of Baghdad have quite obstinately make it clear that nothing but full control of the country , or at least the Anbar governorate , will satisfy they .
they have refuse to participate in the political process , they have repeatedly announce they intention to boycott the election and to disrupt they in other area , and they do not recognise the government or any other authority in the country beside themselves .
the demand of the Fallujah negotiant from the government week ago be obscene and they clearly reflect the overt sectarianism and regionalism of the armed group in the area .
the demand be not release to the iraqi public at the time for unkown reason but they have leak out day ago .
here be just a few of they : - a clear timetable for the withdrawal of foreign occupation force -lrb- fair enough -rrb- .
- Immediate withdrawal of US and iraqi security force from the Anbar governorate and the handover of security responsibility to former army officer from Anbar .
- the appointment of minister from the Anbar governorate to the ministry of Interior , Defense , Oil and Finance .
- the removal of certain official -lrb- most of they from Shi'ite Islamic party such as Ibrahim Al-Ja ` farus -rrb- from governmental position .
- the complete return of ba'athist , army officer , Republican Guards , Mukhabarat , intelligence and security personnel to they former position .
- the removal of shi'ite edhan -lrb- call for prayer -rrb- from official television and radio program .
- income of shi'ite sacred shrine should be return under the control of the Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs .
these last two demand have be allegedly add by Sheikh Harith Al-Dhari -lrb- head of the Association of muslim scholar -rrb- and be say to have be a major reason behind the failure of negotiation with the government .
Iraqis here in the south be shock to hear of these demand and sectarian tension be on the rise .
it scare I to see the reaction of people around I whenever Fallujah be mention .
the director of a primary health care clinic be remark the other day that `` Fallujah should be burn upon its resident and then raze to the ground .
they be the son of mu'awiya , may Allah curse they all . ''
Sidenote : mu'awiya bin Abi Sufyan be the governor of Syria during the 7th century and he fight Imam Ali bin Abi Talib -lrb- Muhammed 's son-in-law -rrb- over the caliphate after the assassination of Caliph Othman .
he become the first Ummayid Caliph and two decade later , under the caliphate of he son Yazid , Imam Hussein bin Ali -lrb- grandson of Muhammed -rrb- be kill by he army at present day Karbala .
someone hush the director and point out to he that I be Sunni .
he be a bit embarrassed and try to explain that he be refer to Wahhabis and foreign fighter .
it be a bit uncomfortable and I could feel that people be give I furtive glance .
refugee have be pour out of Fallujah over the last few day into Baghdad and the surround area .
the military operation will undoubtly aggravate the humanitarian situation inside the city since there be definitely thousand of family with no place to go .
refugee in Baghdad have confirm the rumour that the ` mujahideen ' be force man from 15-50 year old to stay and that they be threaten with execution if they refuse to carry arm in defense of the town .
Majlis Shura Al-Mujahideen -lrb- the Mujahideen Advisory Council -rrb- be in control of Fallujah and they have distribute a statement invite Arab and foreign -lrb- include american -rrb- media reporter to enter the town and cover the battle .
the statement carry the insignia of Zarqawi 's group Qa'idat Al-Jihad .
everyone be closely watch what the next few day will bring , hope the violence do not spread to the street of Baghdad or other area .
I be still hole up in Basrah but I will try to be on the road as soon as possible .
Mark Backer 2004-11-03t13:00:00 I be 36 year old .
I have be around a while .
I be not 87 or anything , but I have see some thing in my life .
I have initially agree and disagree with different thing over the year , only to have my mind change later .
however , I will never ever change my mind about the idiocy we call Daylight Savings Time .
I google `` Daylight Savings Time '' and I get the follow link : http://webexhibits.org/daylightsaving/ I start read ... the site say thing like `` we have learn to save energy and enjoy sunny summer evening by switch we clock a hour forward in the summer '' and there be no s at the end of savings .
it should be Daylight Saving Time .
my apology to the assclown that invent this idiocy and the goober that perpetuate it in such a ridiculous fashion .
I will concede that `` spring forward '' and `` fall back '' be good way to remember to change the battery in you smoke detector .
however , New year and the fourth of July would do the same thing .
I keep read the website of propoganda and find that the first person to come up with the idea be Benjamin Franklin who do it on behalf of some friend that own oil company -lrb- oil be use in lamp -rrb- .
I assume that , because the idea be dumb and inconvenient , lot of people ignore it .
`` by 1966 , some 100 million Americans be observe DST base on they own local law and custom .
Congress decide to step in to end the confusion and establish one pattern across the country .
the Uniform Time Act of 1966 -lrb- 15 U.S. Code Section 260a -rrb- which be sign into Public Law 89-387 on 12 April 1966 , by President Lyndon Johnson , create Daylight Saving Tim to begin on the last Sunday of April and to end on the last Sunday of October .
any state that want to be exempt from DST could do so by pass a state law .
there be a lot more to this since then , and you can read a lot more it if you want to , but this be what I know : Indiana 's eastern half do not use it .
what be that all about ?
Arizona do not use it because one tribe of Indians stretch into three state .
but those other state DO use it .
Hawaii do not use it at all .
of course , they be closer to Japan than to we , and since Japan do not use it , Hawaii just play along .
-lrb- do you think the hawaiian 's sit around , stare west , just becuase they still do not trust the Japs ? -rrb-
regardless of when I go to bed -lrb- 11pm or 10pm or 9pm -rrb- , I get up at 5:30 and I be fuck exhaust .
how can that be ?
I sleep the same number of hour as I do two week ago , yet I be tire ?
also , I be so hungry I could eat my little tub of Carmex by 10:30 be every day .
I use to eat lunch between 11:30 and noon , but now , eating be all I think about after 10am .
why be that good for I ?
I do not care if America save 1 % of its energy consumption cost during those time .
I be tired , hungry , and I leave for work and get home from work in the dark .
how healthy be that ?
for that matter , I do not care about any of the pro-farming or anti-crime propoganda .
Daylight SAVINGS Time suck !!
now , if you will excuse I , I have to go stalk the lobby for the girl that be bring I my krystal .
order and fight to keep myself from fall asleep in my cube .

Mark Backer 2004-11-08T15:07:00 it be auburn-georgia week , lady and gentleman .
after all the smack talk that be go on for the last 360 day , and all of the game that both team have play and the hope each have for the 2004 season , it be come down to this .
to stay undefeated and alive for a chance at the bcs title game , Auburn must win this Saturday in it be 3:30 est game on CBS against the Georgia Bulldogs .
if they hope to move up from they current number five ranking and keep the hope alive of play in the SEC Title Game in December , Georgia must beat Auburn .
this game be as good as it get .
sure , Auburn 's in-state rival be Alabama , but year in and year out , this game , the Auburn-UGA game , seem like the one that matter more .
I seldom if ever root for Bama , but I always root for UGA to be undefeated when the play Auburn .
the game be big enough already , but it seem even bigger when one or both team have something on the line .
yes , both team have other game leave to play and yes , other team ' result may affect what happen to both of these team , but in just five day , these two team will play the biggest and most important game of they season .
so now it be time for all of the yapping and jawing and talk shit that go with this game .
except I do not do that .
I can not do that .
anytime I try to talk shit , I get all nauseous and worry about what happen not if but when we lose .
I do not know if it be just I or if be this pragmatic be what it mean to be a Auburn fan .
I wonder if deep down this be what it feel like to be a red Sox fan : regardless of where you be or what be happen to you team , deep down you do not just think , you know something bad be go to happen .
anyway , I be fly my flag on my house with pride and I be look forward to the game that , year in and year out , give we the best hit and mo entertaining football play on the highest level .
it be SEC football at it be core .
War Eagle .

t12 :00:00 ball
Mark Backer 2004-11-12T07:07:00 it be now just one day until I hop in the car and head back in time to the loveliest village on the plain ... Auburn , Alabama .
I have not be back since 1994 and when I be talk to my wife about the trip this morning , it seem like a lifetime ago .
hell , it be be half my life since I be in school there and over two third of my adult life , assume that people that know I think my adult life have actually start yet .
anyway , enough nostalgia from I , at least for now .
the wife and I be watch SportsCenter this morning , and Lee Corso , Mark May and Trev Alberts be all pick Auburn to beat Georgia , and the last two be pick they to run the table for the right to play USC for the national championship .
Blurble ... .
then , I open the Atlanta paper this morning , and everything be pro-uga .
I mean , I know it would be , but some of it be even base on fact .
like this beauty : when Auburn and they opponent be both in the top ten , Auburn be 4-6-1 in those game .
Auburn have lose the last three game that fit that scenario .
Blurble ... .
Auburn 's last defeat come at the hand of ... UGA .
Blurble ... Auburn do lead the overall record in the series 51-46-8 .
however , the road team 's record in this series .
at Auburn , UGA be 11-8-2 .
at Athens , Auburn be 17-8 .
this trend be serious in the 80 's , with the road team win about two-third of the time .
the only time this change recently really be when UGA decide to win in they place in 2003 .
thanks dawg .
Blurble ... on the upside , Auburn have score at least 33 point in the last six game .
that be a pretty nice run .
Auburn lead the SEC in score offense , score defense and rush defense .
Auburn be second in the nation in score defense and seventh in pass defense .
Jason Campbell be 3rd in the nation in pass efficiency while David Greene be 10th .
here be a couple of middle of the road stats : Auburn 's Quentin Groves and Georgia 's David Pollack be tie for the SEC sack lead .
here be the biggest for what it be worth stat as far as I be concern : both team be undefeated this year when score first .
Auburn be 8-0 and UGA be 5-0 .
I would say that be the biggest stat right now .
Auburn 's offense be potent and efficient .
UGA 's defense be relentless and contain a couple of the country 's biggest hitter , especially Greg Blue and Odell Thurman .
Auburn 's defense be fast and relentless and the db 's be experienced and big .
UGA 's receiver be leader , with one of they a team captain .
Auburn 's two run back be senior and very experienced and dangerous , bruising back .
UGA 's two back be smaller freshman with less experience , but be dangerous as well .
in my mind , the game be go to turn on a few key point , some obvious and some not .
here go the prediction machine : - turnover -lrb- as always -rrb- will be critical .
- special team play and lack of special team mistake will tell the tale regard field position .
- both team MUST establish the run to be successful .
if Auburn go for 150 between they two back , they be almost impossible to beat .
conversely , Georgia MUST be able to run the ball to set up play action and keep the pressure off of David Greene .
- Mark Richt have prove to be a better on the fly adjustment coach that Tommy Tuberville .
tub be famous for take chance , often unnecessary one .
that history be of concern to I .
while it be okay to try crazy shit when you team be under-rated or a serious underdog , it be important not to give game away when you be the favorite .
play more `` by the book '' and a bit `` closer to the vest '' become the call for the day .
consider all of these factor , I truly believe that this be Auburn 's year .
they may not go undefeated and they may not get into the bcs title game , but they have enough talent , poise and experience to win this game .
Auburn win 31-21 .
and now that I have type that prediction , I may just throw up in my mouth .
War ... Blurble ... Eagle !!
add at 1:28 pm on 11/12/04 ack !!
David Greene be the winningest qb in NCAA division I history !!
and he be 15-1 on the road !!
15-1 on the road ???
UGA win 24-21 Blurble .
Mark Backer 2004-11-17T07:23:00 you know , for the past five day and really for about the past fifteen or twenty day , I have be angry about the bcs ranking and why Auburn be not rank higher and all of that business .
can someone tell I why one of my friend or family member have not smack I because of it ?
I mean , here we be , 10-0 and stare down the barrell of a road game at Tuscaloosa against we hate rival , the Alabama Crimson Tide , and I be bitch about how we better get to play for a national title ?
really ?
you do not have to think back too far to find a similar scenario , only with the shoe firmly on the other foot .
in 1989 , Alabama be 10-0 , number two in the nation and come into Auburn for the first time ever to play at Jordan-Hare Stadium .
all the talk for the week lead up to the game be about `` if Bama 's undefeated , they will play for it all in the Sugar Bowl '' and other crap like that .
well , `` if or when '' never happen because Auburn win 30-20 in one of the greatest iron Bowl game ever , put a end to Bama 's national title hope for the year .
15 year later , the situation 's reverse .
it be Auburn that be undefeated and face the road game at the end of the season .
suddenly , I be about nauseous about this game too .
despite be riddled with injury , Alabama have a ridiculously stout defense , recently rank as the number one defense in the country .
egad .
have all of the bluster and talk show up on the plain as well ?
I only hope that coach Tuberville have be successful at keep he player focus , motivated and think about ONLY the Alabama game .
Mark Backer 2004-11-17t11:07:00 for those of you not from around these part , Linda Schrenko be the state of Georgia 's Superintendant of school .
it seem that in recent year , instead of do the people 's business , good ole Linda have spend she time steal over 600 grand in Federal Education fund .
she use it for various thing , but the favorite be the nine grand she spend on a facelift .
here be a link to the story : link one thing that make I laugh be that she show up at she indictment in a fur coat .
Ummm , be I the only one that learn anything from the Michael Irvin drug trial of the mid 90 's ?
you never ever show up at court , especially face indictment for steal large sum of money , wear a fucking fur coat !!
fake or not , you look like you be rub the common man 's nose in it .
Schrenko be a scumbag and , although she will not get any actual jail time , I hope the fine she plead to be at least as much as what she steal .
otherwise , she be learn nothing .
remember when Michael Milken get bust , he be not force to give up he secret account , and when the fine of 600 million be levy ... he pay it !!
hell , at he zenith , that be what he make in one year !!
`` um ... how much , you honor ?
600 large ?
yeah , lem I just get my checkbook out of my diamond encrust briefcase . ''
Schrenko steal 20 time what Martha Stewart do , and I bet she will not see the wrong side of a jail cell door , and that be sad .
because it be people like Schrenko for which jail be specifically design ...
Mark Backer 2004-11-19T10:02:00 Well , it be mid-morning on the East coast and I be sit here run number thru my head try to figure out what be go to happen in the Iron Bowl , which be just over 29 hour away .
the game be be play in Tuscaloosa , which should be a advantage to Alabama .
however , in the two time the game have be play in Bryant Denny Stadium , Auburn have win .
Alabama have one of the stingiest defens in the country , and be rank number one in overall defense as recently as last week .
conversely , Auburn have one of the most potent and balanced offensive attack in the nation .
also , I do not think Bama have face a attack with two great runner , a great line , a poise qb and good receiver and a tight end as well .
Bama be miss it be start offensive backfield from the start of the season .
the fact that they have win six game be a testament to the coaching and heart of the player .
Alabama simply can not throw the football , which be a good thing , because Auburn 's defensive backfield be second to none .
Bama can run the ball however .
unfortunately for they , with no passing game to keep the defense honest , Auburn will probably stack nine in the box , play man on the corner , and dare Bama to run , and I do not think they will be able to do it .
Auburn be also 9-0 when they score first .
the Tuberville way be to get one quick and early to get you crowd into it if you be at home and to quiet the other team 's crowd if you be on the road .
you can never tell what be go to happen in rivalry game .
in this exact game 15 year ago , Bama come into Auburn # 2 in the country , undefeated at 10-0 and look for yet another national championship .
they be summarily trounce 30-20 in a game in which the score be closer than the actual game .
that could very well happen Saturday .
I always tell people that the Georgia game matter more to I than the Bama game .
I live in Georgia , and lose that game affect I much more directly than lose the Alabama game .
that say , when kickoff time come , you remember all the reason that you hate Alabama and they dumbass haircut and they detergent and toilet paper and they houndstooth hat and they `` Bear this '' and `` Bear that , '' and everything else that go along with it .
this be not a football game , and it be not two drunken cousin fight at a family reunion .
this be brother against brother after one sleep with the other 's wife and then brag about it .
it be that serious .
however , when it be all say and do , I just do not think Alabama have the horse to stand up to what I believe be go to be enormous defensive pressure .
if Auburn take care of the ball and execute , this game should not be as close as some think .
my call : Auburn 37 Alabama 13 now pass the Tums .
I do not feel so well ... War Eagle !!
Mark Backer 2004-11-28T16:41:00 we have be on the go since about noon on Wednesday and even longer in the wife 's case .
she start clean about a week before the holiday and clean for about two week right thru the holiday .
we spend Friday do a little shopping and get to bed early , but Saturday be busy with football watch .
the irish suck .
not as a people , but as a football team .
the look good for 15 minute , but then they get run over by Matt Leinert and USC .
I have no beef with usc be number one , but Oklahoma be nowhere close to number two in the country , and I be sick of the pollster who only look at east coast score instead of watch tape of the game .
Auburn have trail in exactly two game this year , and have give up less than 9.5 point per game .
Oklahoma have give up bucketload of point , but still get some mystery respect for it .
-lrb- I know many of you may be tire of my rant about this , have no fear .
it will all be over by next Sunday night or Monday morning .
at that point , we be either in or fucked and either way , I be write about it once then , and that will be it -rrb- .
anyway , we decide to go ahead and get a fake tree yesterday , and we get that bad boy put up yesterday and be decorate it today .
we also get all of we exterior light up today , mark the first time this family have ever have they decorating do by Thanksgiving Sunday .
big kudos to the missus .
it feel weird not watch racing today , but it will get easier and then , come January 10th or so , there will be test news and driver signing news and we will be on the back side of the remain 84 day until the Daytona 500 .
until tomorrow kid , war eagle !!
Mark Backer 2004-12-02T07:11:00 apparently Jason Giambi , recently the non-playing and `` sick '' first baseman of the New York Yankees , admit to a Grand Jury that he `` inject anabolic steroid and human growth hormone -lrb- hgh -rrb- as recently as 2003 .
and he apparently get they thru BALCO and -lrb- surprise -rrb- the same guy that be Barry Bonds ' trainer , once Greg Anderson .
since that Grand jury testimony be give , Giambi repeatedly deny use any steroid , hgh , or anything else to anyone and everyone that would listen .
Jason 's brother Jeremy also admit to the grand jury that he use steroid .
now , Barry be deny he be do any steroid and Gary Sheffield 's deny he be do any steroid , but one by one , the lesser -lrb- and bigger -rrb- player in this deal be see they testimony come into the the public eye where they admit that they do do steroid .
it seem that anyone associate with this special `` trainer '' Greg Anderson be come up dirty .
it be a good thing that Major League Baseball have such a tough steroid policy , or this story may not have be bring to we attention .
-lrb- cough ... cough ... sarcasm ... cough -rrb- .
never mind if the steroid and human growth hormone be illegal in baseball or not .
they be illegal to use in the United States .
I want to know where the Federal criminal charge against all party involve be .
anyone ?
the fact that these guy -lrb- sheff , the Giambis , Marion Jones , Bonds and many other -rrb- be run around deny this shit and act like Pete Rose do any time someone ask he about gambling -lrb- get uber defensive , deny it implicitly and act like the person ask have personally assault he -rrb- be appalling .
these clown be mess with people 's career by insist they be be lie about , yet when it turn out the reporter be not lie and the athlete be , nothing be do .
I have never deny that Barry Bonds be a special and gifted athlete .
whether it be steroid , hgh , crank , lighter fluid or antifreeze he be use , be able to perform at this level for this length of time defy logic or reason .
that be why it be a shame that , in the final analysis , all of bond ' number and accomplishment be go to be ignore and lump into the statement `` yeah , but he be on steroid . ''
it be a pity he and the other be too dumb to see that .
and now , just so you do not think that every entry in this blog will be like the one above , here be a great joke I read today : a man take he Rottweiler to the vet and say , `` my dog 's cross-eyed , be there anything you can do for he ? ''
`` well , '' say the vet , `` let 's have a look at he . ''
so he pick the dog up and examine he eye , then check he tooth .
finally , the vet say `` I be go to have to put he down . ''
`` what ?
because he be cross-eyed ? ''
`` no , because he be really heavy . ''
I will be break down the SEC championship game either later today or tomorrow , so I expect you all to be plant firmly on the edge of you seat wait for that one .
War Eagle everybody !
Mark Backer 2004-12-06t07:33:00 I be have a difficult time put my feeling into word right now , so bear with I .
First of all , I want to congratulate the Auburn Football team for do what no other Auburn football team have do ; go 12-0 .
they also win they first outright SEC title since 1987 and win they first SEC title since the conference impliment the Championship game format .
a year ago , the program be in disarray and the coach be one poorly execute plane trip away from be fire by a over-zealous and too empower booster with a fat checkbook .
since that day , the team be undefeated and have win 14 game in a row .
they have now beat four team that be in the top 15 at the time the game be play , and two of those game be win away from Jordan-Hare Stadium .
on championship weekend , the big three all play .
USC win by five over a shitty UCLA team with a 6-5 record , and that be thanks in part to a official who blow dead a clear and obvious fumble that would have be return for a UCLA touchdown .
Oklahoma play in it be conference title game against a four-loss Colorado team that can not throw the ball .
the result be a 40 plus point beatdown , but what do anyone expect ?
Auburn play 15th rank Tennessee and be attempt to do one of the toughest thing to do in college football : beat a team twice in the same year .
with the exception of a 15 yard shank punt and a punt snap that Kody Bliss miss while have a apparent thrombosis , Auburn lead 21-7 at the half and have hold UT to 46 yard of offense .
while the Auburn run game be hold up , Jason Campbell throw it all over the ball field and , when he receiver be cover , he run for yardage on he own .
this despite several late hit to the head , low hit at he knee and ankle , and various other assault outside the realm of good sportsmanship .
Tennessee score on a pass play that be incorrectly rule a touchdown , since the ball clearly touch the turf , and that be where the momentum of the game change .
I think it be also at that point that the scoreboard begin to reflect Auburn 's last title hope die as the oklahoma-colorado score would have begin show the beat-down that be occur .
Auburn be tie 21-21 and in jeapordy of lose it most important game ever , but senior QB Jason Campbell would have none of it .
Auburn win go away 38-28 , and the only place the game look close be on the scoreboard .
I can not believe that a undefeated SEC team be not play for a title , but I guess we can thank Jeff Sagarin and the other dick that keep vote USC number one to make up for what happen to they last year .
all I know be that they better think that way next year , because it be Auburn that get screw this year .
and what be better be that Auburn get to play one of the three hottest team in the country in my opinion .
Virginia Tech be talented , very athletic and one of the most well coach team in the country and they will come to play on January 3rd .
I hope we kid can shake off this travesty and focus on make the pollster look like idiot .
maybe a Oklahoma win in a butt-ugly game and a great Auburn performance could help .
what be the definition of pragmatic ?
go undefeated and chant `` we be number two !! ''

Mark Backer 2004-12-16t06:56:00 I be read ESPN this morning when I stumble across the story where Kobe Bryant say he would like to sit down with Shaq and apologize to he for `` involve he in my trouble . ''
Bryant also say that he think December 25th `` sound like a good day to I to kind of talk to he and tell he I never mean in any kind of way to bring any of he personal business out . ''
you see , after Kobe 's world fall apart because he could not resist bang the crazy white towel clerk at he hotel , he need a out .
he buy he wife a four million dollar ring and get some tattoo that say how much he love she , but he need to do more to attract attention away from himself .
so he tell the media that he should have do what Shaq always do , just pay the woman to shut up .
Kobe also allege that O'neal have pay upward of one million dollar in this way as hush money over the year .
Shaq have deny it from the beginning , but that be not really the point .
it be no secret that a large number of the NBA 's `` star '' be not exactly star-worthy .
good player or not , guy like Kemp and Bryant and Iverson and the entire Blazers team be just not very nice or good people .
if the league will tolerate it , what do I care ?
but the real issue be this .
Kobe 's Lakers will play Shaq 's Miami Heat on ... that be right ... December 25th .
so the real motivation for Kobe here be not to mend fence or admit he be wrong to involve any other person in he own little pit of woe .
it be to find some sort of way to keep the 340-pound shaquille and he teammate from beat the ever-loving shit out of Kobe for 48 pain-filled minute on Christmas Day .
I can not tell you the number of way that Kobe Bryant make I sick .
despite he slick talk and he nice diction , he be nothing but a cheater and a liar and a punk .
I hardly watch any NBA game because the league and most of it be player sicken I , but I have have December 25th circle on my calendar since the day after Shaq sign with the Heat .
that be the day that Shaq will take a million dollar or more out of Kobe 's punk-ass .
Mark Backer 2004-12-17T16:39:00 Sorry I have not be post much lately .
we have be so damned busy with the holiday -lrb- that be what we call December at we house -rrb- that I just have not have time .
I read a funny joke today and I think I would share it with you .
one of my fellow egger post it , so Chet , here 's you credit : a traveler be drive through Arkansas when he lose he way and get off the main highway .
as he drive by , he see row and row of pigsty and pigpen and pig run in field and pig wallow in mud .
suddenly , he eye catch something really strange .
he do a double take , mutter to himself and then look a third time .
he wonder if he have see correctly - it look like a pig with a wooden leg !
he find the lane to the farm and drive up into the farmyard , where he be meet by the farmer .
`` excuse I , '' the traveler say .
`` I be just drive by and look at all you pig , and I notice something that I just have to stop and ask about .
tell I , do I see right ?
be there really a pig out there with a wooden leg ? ''
the farmer smile .
`` oh , that would be old Caesar you see .
he be the finest pig a man could ever hope to have - and smart !
well , let I tell you a little about that pig .
you see that barge down there on the river ?
that be a mining dredge , take out platinum ore .
old Caesar sniff out the vein and show we how to set it up .
now that dredge bring I in about $ 120,000 every year .
`` there be another thing , too , a little more personal .
one night a couple of year ago I get to drinking and I guess I have more than I should have .
I pass out drunk , fall down and knock over a lamp .
that start a fire in the house and old Caesar smell the smoke .
he come in the back door , get the wife and kid out , rouse I up and get I out .
`` there be no question about it - that night old Caesar save all we life and you know that be not the sort of thing a man be go to forget too easily . ''
`` why , '' the traveler say , `` this be all amazing !
I have never hear of a pig like this before !
this be fantastic !
but tell I , how do he get that wooden leg ?
be he in a wreck or something ? ''
the farmer laugh and say , `` well , naturally , when you have a pig that smart , you do not want to eat he all at one time ! ''
Mark Backer 2004-12-20T09:19:00 while it be entertaining , that be not why I be post about it .
I do not normally post about pro football , but what I see deserve a ranting or two , and I suspect it be go to get many more in the day and week to come .
with 4:41 leave in the fourth quarter and the Packers down by 11 , Favre hit Robert Ferguson with a 31 yard strike near the left hash mark .
come from the other direction , Jacksonville DB Donovin Darius unloaded chin high on Ferguson with a vicious clothesline .
remarkably , Ferguson hold on to the ball , despite be disjoin from he helmet on the hit .
after many minute lie motionless on the field , Ferguson be finally remove via stretcher , give a thumb up to the crowd on the way out .
the Packers go on to lose the game , but that be not the story here .
this be not one of the stage stiff-armed clothesline you see in professional wrestling broadcast .
this be a vicious , arm cock and swing clothesline that literally could have tear Ferguson 's head off of he body .
the play be immediately flag , and moment later it be announce that Darius have be eject , much to the crowd 's delight .
one sidenote here be that , despite they rabid fandom and the situation , not one thing be throw at the offend player as he leave the field .
it would have be easy to bathe he in beer or snowball or battery as he leave , but the Packer fan be classier than that .
to a person , they act with class , use they voice and not projectile to express they displeasure .
this be the most vicious and blatantly dirty play I have see in the NFL since Jim McMahon be body slam to the ground in the mid 80 's about five seconds after he have release a pass .
and Jaguars coach Jack Del Rio and Darius have the nerve to vociferously argue with official about Darius ' ejection from the game .
I do not care what anyone say about `` you can not judge intent . ''
Darius ' intent be to dismember , injure or even kill Ferguson .
the more I see the replay , the sicker it make I feel .
the league must take action , and it must be swift and sure .
I be talk about a four game suspension that include the playoff if necessary .
in this day and age of bigger , stronger and faster player , injury be go to happen accidentally all of the time .
there be simply no room for the kind of play that result in Ferguson 's injury .
Paul Tagliabue must give word to all of he employee that action like this will not be tolerate .
maybe that will tell the Jaguars , Darius and player like he that this kind of head-hunting will not be tolerate in the NFL .
if not , I fully expect the Packers and many other team to handle this matter `` on the field '' with Darius be the target of similar attack by tight end and offensive lineman .
Mark Backer 2005-01-03t08:29:00 I be on vacation from December 23rd until today , January 3rd .
it be tough to come back to work after be go for ten day , but I think it be tougher to stay home and try to do what my wife do every day , which be work , raise we daughter , keep the house , cook , and everything else .
thanks for everything babe .
now , the thing I forget to tell you be that when I walk out of the office to go home on the 23rd , there be a pink post it on my car .
it say : `` hi !
I scrape you bumper .
sorry !
: -lrb- call I Joyce _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 770-239-x x x x 12/23/04 really .
include the sad face .
I be happy she leave the note and take responsibility for it , but what in the fuck be go on that every couple of month I be take car to the shop for thing that be not my fault ?
this be the third incident in 15 month , and two of the three involve other folk hit my park car !!
I know my 20 year clean record would end sometime , but do the karma god have to beat I over the head with a shovel about it ?
so today I have Enterprise pick I up at 7:15 , which be great .
I be worry about be late to work and , as it turn out , I be only 16 minute late .
I be give a choice between a taurus and a impala .
I take the impala .
I make the wrong choice .
it drive like shit .
so much for my GM loyalty .
they make great truck and suv 's , but they sedan suck ass .
I will return this piece of shit on Friday , only to rent another vehicle Monday morning while we take the wife 's car to the shop to get she 1400 buck worth of damage repair .
I actually do not know if it will be Monday yet , as I didn ' twant to ruin Joyce 's New year by give she the bad news .
I plan to call she this morning and tell she the total , complete with my rental car for a week .
I will let you know how it go .
happy New year .
peace on earth .
Goodwill towards all man , and keep away from my fucking vehicle !!
Mark Backer 2005-01-05T15:26:00 The college football season be finally over .
on one hand , I be a bit sad because year like this only happen for Auburn every 15 or 20 year , so it be a little disappointing .
on the other hand , this work out about as well as it could .
if you ask I at the beginning of the year if I would rather be 8-3 and play in the liberty bowl or 12-0 with a chance to win the Sugar Bowl , go 13-0 and finish second , I would say hell yeah to the latter .
the fact that pundit put OU ahead of Auburn base on they out of conference schedule be tougher than ours be laughable now .
in the end , play Bowling Green over we play the Citadel do not make the Sooners much better .
man , I have see softer takedown on cop .
USC come on to the field , give up a td , then decide to make choke-lahoma they collective bitch , and they do just that .
38-10 at the half mean that I do not even have to hear that die hyena Ashlee `` no , I be the one with dark hair and no boob '' Simpson butcher yet another song on tv .
hell , I read it on Fark this morning .
Hooray for big first half beating that get I a extra hour of sleep .
we might not have win , but we would not have let Leinert go long on we all night either .
we db 's would have have something to say about that .
and , it turn out that when play a decent team , OU can not do shit on offense .
that be just plain terrible .
Jason White look like Jason Voorhees out there , stomp around get catch from every direction any time he do not hand of to Peterson for a three yard loss .
in five year , Oklahoma have play in four huge game , and lose three of they ... badly .
that must feel like be a Sox fan before this year , I would imagine .
anyway , I feel great .
think about this .
a year ago , Tuberville be one reporter 's abililty to find a out of place airplane in Ohio away from be fire before the Alabama game .
then , the ad and president get can , a booster start down the long road to shun-ville , and Tuberville keep smile and say the right thing .
he talk he two run back and two stellar db 's into staying , then knock out 15 straight win and sign one of those super iron-clad contract that will pay he 14 million over seven year , and if Auburn even think ... think about let he go , they owe he every penny .
I do not even think there be a morality clause .
he could have sex with a endanger bald Eagle , and they would still have to pay he .
and that be the way it should be .
meanwhile , Auburn fan can spend the next six month say `` yeah , but we would have do this '' or `` we be 13-0 , win the sec , beat five top ten team , three of they on the road , and become the only undefeated SEC team in the bcs 's history to not play for the title . ''
and coincidentally , Oklahoma 's play in it this year , last year , and in 2000 .
you win in 2000 , but you get punk the last two year , and last year you get to play for the title even though you do not even win you conference .
you get embarass by Kansas State and LSU last year , and humiliate this year .
but the little 12 be sooo much better than the SEC .
that be why you play a four-loss team for you conference title this year .
and , consider the bcs be run by the head of the big 12 , it be no wonder you get the benefit of the doubt .
do not think so ?
how about the fact that only two team that do not win they conference have ever play for the national title ?
you and Nebraska in 2001 .
oh , the other thing you two big 12 team have in common be that you get you ass kick on the sport 's biggest stage .
so yes , we be disappointed .
but all you can do be play the schedule in front of you .
Auburn do that with class and dignity , they win every game , face down every challenge , and make every Auburn fan in the country and the world proud .
War Eagle !!
now , can someone get the Auburn cheerleader some of those USC sweater ?
Meow !
Mark Backer 2005-01-05T16:32:00 much like the `` I tell you so be '' everyone be throw at the UGA basketball program after they hiring and subsequent firing of the Harricks , folk around the Buckeye state have to be have similar thought .
it seem that ad and frequent `` no we do not '' Ohio State front man Andy Geiger be `` retire '' after 11 year at the helm .
maybe it be I , but I be guess Andy 's tired of put on tv makeup and go on the news lie about what he or Tressel know about they athlete in general and they football program in particular .
it seem that Maurice Clarrett-gate just be not go away .
two year ago , everyone be say `` shame on you , Maurice .
you should have know better . ''
now , it seem like most folk be say `` Shame on you both Andy and Jim .
you both should have know better . ''
allegation have come to light that several OSU player receive illegal benefit include cash , access to car , etc. .
now , I do not expect the ad and coach to know everything , but when a player be drive a brand new car every couple of week or month , well , somebody ought to jot a memo and get to the bottom of that .
it should not surprise Buckeye fan either , since Tressel have similar problem at Youngstown State , and leave a wake of controversy behind himself there as well , include -lrb- surprise -rrb- illegal benefit include cash , car , grade fix , etc. .
Geiger be also tire from say `` we do not do anything wrong '' about he basketball program .
of course , it be discover that he man 's basketball coach have directly give six grand to a yugoslavian recruit , but that be just he stipend for travel and coach Jim O'Brien be just have a problem with the currency exchange rate ... right Andy ?
I only hope that the NCAA will do something they rarely do : make a good sound decision and take away Ohio State 's national title from January 2003 .
it seem they have a very important and very ineligible player that season , and maybe many .
I would hate to give another title to Thugtown Miami , but I would give it to Alabama before I would think it be okay for Ohio State to keep .
Mark Backer 2005-02-17T06:47:00 would it make a noise and if it do , would anyone south of Boston give a shit ?
Wednesday , Commissioner Gary Bettman announce the cancellation of the 2004-2005 nhl season .
as if everyone do not already know that be the case .
shame on the nhl and shame on the player ' association for not get a deal do , but I put much more of the blame on the owner as this `` negotiation '' come down to the wire .
I understand that the league be lose less money by not play than it would have by have a season this year .
I also understand that when push come to shove , the player give in and accept a salary cap .
okay , the side be about 7 million per team apart , but could not they just say `` alright , let 's split that in half and play hockey ? ''
I mean holy Christ people , two kid argue over 10 buck would work it out that way .
why be this any different ?
the nhl 's primary goal be to get a salary cap approve by the player , and they finally do .
and what do the nhl do when that momentus event occur ?
they leave the negotiating table .
Gary Bettman be a mindless troll and the professional sport commissioner equivalent of Joe Hazelwood and this lockout / strike / cluster fuck be the reef .
the first thing that need to happen be that Bettman and Goodenow -lrb- the player ' association rep -rrb- need to be fire , deport , flog , tar and feathered and finally force to pay for four ticket plus a program , four dog , four beer , and two coke and parking to a game at a nhl arena for every day of the next season so they understand what the fan go thru to see a hockey game .
then , all current contract need to be void by the end of the season in 2006 .
that mean no team would own any player , and the owner would be free to sign whomever they would like use the `` fiscal restraint '' they all drone on and on about all year .
that way , they would only pay as much as they could afford ... right ?
wrong .
those douchebag would end up overspend like every professional sport owner because they can not control themselves .
if Mr. Iginla or Heatley be free agent , for example , owner would bid each other out of they mind , then they would be leave with not enough to get a competetive team .
while the business model in the nhl be certainly flaw and the owner need help , they really need help to protect they from themselves .
and the fact be that without that help , the owner would follow the same path that get they where they be right now anyway .
the biggest issue be this , however .
very few people give one hot shit whether the nhl play another game ever , let alone this season or the next one .
for every cry canuck there be 1,000 or more other who say `` no hockey ?
Huh ... do not even notice . ''
and the last television network interested in carry hockey -lrb- ESPN -rrb- may opt out of televising the nhl next season , mean that all of the team would be in huge trouble , because no tv = no league .
period .
Atlanta lose the Flames 25 year ago because , despite full house every night , it be tv revenue that pay the freight and the Flames have no tv contract .
imagine a entire league with no tv contract .
hell , Major League Soccer and the WNBA DO have a tv contract and no one give a shit about they .
I will say this for the nhl , when they screw up , they screw up huge .
Congrats guy .
you will forever be know as the generation that kill professional hockey in North America .
that will look great on you resume .
Byrne 2004-12-09T14:01:00 Shares of Martha Stewart live Omnimedia , a company whose name be so breathtakingly self-promoting it make I long for the day when every single entity involve in real estate or casino be call Trump , continue to soar ; it rise $ 1.78 , or 7.29 % , on news that the company 's namesake will star in a new tv show once she , er ... get out of prison .
now , I know there have be succesful company that deal with crook -lrb- Warner Communications , which start as a merger between business in the three most mob-influenced industry around , come to mind -rrb- , but it be a gamble and not a business strategy .
the company 's performance be not all that hot even before the CEO go to prison , and until very recently the stock price reflect that .
but this be a one-person company , and at this point it be say the ` Martha ' brand be worth some $ 1.31 billion .
if anything , the value of the brand should decline over time , inasmuch as she be rather , well , mortal .
and she be be convinct of obstruction of justice .
this runup be base on the inexplicable hope that now that the head of the firm and the embodiment of a much-resented brand be no longer do time for lie to the federal government , they will be able to really coin some money .
I just do not know what to say .
muckdog ????
- ??
- ??
t15 :03:00 Martha should do a reality show .
take 10 contestant , and give they a situation : you have company come over for dinner ; you be host a open house ; or , you be host a wedding reception .
then , she just rank they and eliminate one every week .
the stock would really go to the moon on that press release .
Byrne 2004-12-11T18:45:00 scrappy underdog Netflix have its day earlier in the year , when it become one of the hottest stock around -lrb- sport a eye-popping P/E in the high 900 's on the way up , and , thanks to a poor earnings report , over 1,000 on the way down -rrb- .
there be plenty of argument about the future of dvd and video rental , and Netflix represent a pure-play on one of the three dominant hypothesis : I .
that business be o-v-e-r -- between pay-per-view , video-on-demand , pirate movie , high-bandwidth internet broadcast , and the increase availability of other media , it take some faith to see any future for movie rental .
those who do not have the requisite faith will point to these factor as proof that the business be die and the movie business in general will need a pretty significant overhaul before it can make profit .
movie rental be no longer a cheap alternative to other way of view film ; they be the stodgy , expensive way .
there be not any pure-play buy on this theory , but someone who believe it might overweight they portfolio in cable company -- if they purchase any media stock at all .
of course , there have be company whose performance would perfectly mimic the validity of this idea , but Psuedo.com fail without produce a single show , and Broadcast.com be swallow for $ 6 billion by yahoo! , to Yahoo! 's great regret .
II .
not so fast -- it will just go online !
-- anyone who want to counter that argument would probably start by take we back to 1997 , when in term of time use , text be the most popular kind of information online .
at the time , and for year after , people argue that the traditional bookstore would become obsolete .
after all , how could we stand for a rapaciously arborcidal medium like ` book ' or ` newspaper ' when we could transmit the same datum as bit and byte and save on transportation , too ?
as it turn out , of course , Amazon.com , BarnseandNoble.com , and a host of other simply take the bookstore model , attach a 56k modem , and declare themselves the Future .
Netflix be do much the same thing : take the traditional business online to cut cost and boost customer service .
III .
who d'you think you be kid ?
you can not kill movie rental store -- so there be a big difference between movie and book : for book , the retail store be practically the sole medium of distribution ; if you do not sell through they , book will not get sell .
for movie , the video rental store be just one way to get video out there -lrb- though at 45-55 % of studio revenue , it be a much more important one than people think -rrb- .
but give the high valuation ascribe to bricks-and-mortar-and-dead tree bookseller like Barnes and Noble , Borders , and to a much lesser extent Books-A-Million , surely there be room for a Blockbuster , along with a Movie Gallery or two .
the latter , at least , still have room to grow .
by focus on smaller , rural community -lrb- preferably the sort that consider dsl ` newfangled ' -rrb- they be walmart WalMart -- compete with Walmart 's awful in-store video rental by offer better selection and much lower price .
the movie business be change dramatically as the potential for online distribution grow , but like every other business it leave lot of room for traditional operator to operate at traditional -lrb- read : high -rrb- profit .
the aggressive bidding war for Hollywood Video , feature two of they competitor , a buyout shop , and one of the savviest raider around , be proof that some people still think these store be worth something .
and I be one of they .
full disclosure : for once , I be actually write about something I own : I have share of Movie Gallery , I have suggest it to friend , and I would be quite thrill if the stock go up .
I do not do ` sell target ' , but I would probably hold the stock if it run up anything less than 50 % from this level .
if I sell , I will post a notification one trading day beforehand .
because Lord know you care .
Byrne 2004-12-12T14:47:00 Conglomerates be a fascinating species : the standard definition be ' a company involve in multiple unrelated business ' but the more accurate definition would be ' a company that rely on financial pyrotechnics , balance sheet juggling , and adroit accounting to create the illusion of growth ' .
I love to write about they , but I would hate to own one , since most of they market value come from the market 's assumption that the company 's leader will somehow find a way to retroactively justify they overvaluation .
usually , it do not work , but when it do the result can be spectacularly entertaining .
for a while -lrb- see ling-temco-vought or Tyco for detail -rrb- .
the recent rumor about WalMart 's plan to buy out a shipping company have give rise to the fear that the company may go the conglomerate route .
they have many of the symptom of a late-stage conglomerate : a gigantic main business with slow growth , fear that competition will substantially reduce the profitability of they main business , a shareholder base that include many people who own only WalMart stock -lrb- thus provide another incentive for intracompany diversification -rrb- , and enough resource to pull it off on a grand scale .
I can understand the concern , but I do not see the motivation .
as a retailer of just about everything , WalMart can expand into some pretty broadly-defined area without go beyond either they core competency or some arena where they can cut cost .
after all , add some international shipping asset to they holding would be a natural extension of they enormously successful practice of buy the distribution network for they product .
they be come close to Smithfield Food 's very successful ` squeal to meal ' policy ; if these rumor be true , the result for shareholder will be a pretty positive one .
Byrne 2004-12-13T07:22:00 so Oracle and Peoplesoft , who spend the last 18 month insulting one another in every imaginable way , be finally tie the knot ?
the final price , $ 26.50 per share , beat all the previous bid by a huge margin -- of course , Oracle lowbal they earlier offer , and end up basically bidding against themselves and the optimism of other Peoplesoft shareholder for a year and a half .
it be be a pretty grueling fight -lrb- be it worth it ?
how much of Peoplesoft 's most valuable -- human -- resource will walk out the door the day they option vest ? -rrb-
make all the more so by the widely-held assumption that Larry Ellison be either bluffing or screw around .
so it be over .
I do not have Oracle/Peoplesoft 's spat to kick around anymore .
I will have to stick with condemn the merger as a totally unworkable deal between two side who absolutely hate each other .
and I will not dwell on the irony of a Oracle employee be drive out of Oracle , start he own company , and force Ellison to spend $ 10.3 billion to get he company -- but not he -- back -lrb- though it do rather delightfully remind I of Coca-Cola basically give away the bottle franchise and then spend billion to buy it back -rrb- .
Ellison be brilliant enough to make this merger work , but he be crazy enough to wreck even the soundest of deal .
we shall see .
Byrne 2004-12-15T21:28:00 back in the day -lrb- 2000-2003 or so -rrb- some of the hottest non-homebuilding stock be the gaming equipment manufacturer , who ride a wave of heavy reinvestment in casino to produce huge profit .
now , all that reinvestment have pay off , and , along with a good dose of consolidation , make the industry moderately hot again .
like every boom , whether merit or not , the big company have big move in the early stage , but it do not get attention or turn into a mania until we see a frenetic ipo or two .
you know where this be go : Las Vegas Sands kick off its first trading day with a 60 % gain after a last-minute increase in offering price to $ 29 a share , outside the $ 24 - $ 26 range bandy about after they drop they first $ 20 - $ 22 estimate .
but , well , the business be complicate and the business be tough .
Wynn Resorts , another owner of the lucrative Macau license that capture investor 's attention during the IPO , illustrate this well enough : Steve Wynn , the company 's founder , make a gigantic fortune when he bet he company 's future on Atlantic City .
when investor see he $ 160 million all-debt investment turn into a $ 440 million asset in just a few year -- he net worth take a similar , though even less gravitationally-bound arc , rise from $ 2 million to $ 75 million durign the same time -rrb- they all rush in .
needless to say , Wynn sell when everyone else buy , and he make it through the cannibalize near-collapse those casino face in the early 90 's .
so , applause and cheer all around to the casino raise such spectacular sum for you broad-scoped ambition .
and a premature apology to the newly-minted shareholder , who will doubtless see some eye-popping return in the right direction for a little while and then face a long road back to the reality that be a price around half the current one .
full disclosure , just for the hell of it : I be bearish about the Google IPO , too .
thank God I do not sell short
Byrne 2004-12-17T08:01:00 Gazprom , the main russian gas company , have be deny a $ 10 billion credit line due to the political situation in Russia .
the company intend to use the cash to pay a artificially low price for Yukos asset -lrb- hence that firm 's bankruptcy file a few day ago -- you know it be bad when you have to use US court to protect you own asset from appropriation by you home country -rrb- .
it be start to look like Putin 's goal be a sort of judicial nationalization -- take control of key asset through court , rather than executive , fiat .
but the market have catch on , and Russia may be deprive of the capital it need to grow .
do not expect any of the russian leadership to reverse course ; give the current trend there , they will just blame the West when they screwy plan screw they over .
Byrne 2004-12-19T15:09:00 so far , the Yukos auction have produce more question than answer , and so far the biggest of the former be just who make off with they prize asset .
auctioneer report a $ 9.3 billion win bid for Yuganskneftgaz -- the company 's main asset , worth two to three time that amount -- by a anonymous company locate in Tver .
well , sort of .
it turn out the anonymous company , BaikalFinansGroup , share a address with OOO Tverneftemash , which be recently buy by ZAO Gazpromgeocomservice , not to ever be confuse by the similarly-named Gazprom -lrb- which by the way have a similar logo -rrb- .
Gazprom , of course , be the gigantic , kremlin-supported gas company most observer assume would bid for the asset .
there be not many group in Russia who can afford a $ 9.3 billion bet , particularly when it be such a politically-weighted one .
Gazprom may have arrange some last-minute debt financing , or might have a outside partner , but I seriously doubt they be not in some way involve with the company that win the auction .

Byrne 2004-12-20T15:37:00 Microscopic microcap Everlast , mainly a maker of boxing equipment , have soar over the last several day thanks to a licensing deal with Jacques Moret allow Moret to buy out they woman 's apparel license for $ 30 million , on top of a $ 12.5 million payment now .
in other word , a competitor have decide that one segment of the company 's business be potentially worth $ 42.5 million .
investor have prudently value the remain business -- the extremely well-known Everlast brand , the possible new reality tv show , and most of the company 's asset -- at a negative $ 16.5 million .
the company 's stock would have to rise more than 50 % from the current level to put a zero value on that business .
and , who know ?
it might .
Byrne 2005-01-05T19:01:00 Well , we do not , but we have something very much like it : a company hit and then rehitt low that would have be unthinkable even after they pull-back a year ago , accusation and proof of some less-than-kosher accounting , and , best of all , allegation of egregious self-dealing by insider .
a glance at the analyst opinion show that they have a lone bull cheerleading the stock , and plenty of bear hammer it .
that be evidence enough that it be underprice ; the market usually react to a downgrade by drop the stock a percent or two , but I can not help it -- I presume most of these downgrade arise from the classic `` well , what do you analyst think ? ''
`` he say it be a buy , '' `` well , what be it do this year ? ''
conversation .
nobody want to be catch recommend a loser , and unlike portfolio manager with a net Asset Value report card every trading day , analyst can essentially start fresh with each new opinion .
the best analyst get note , laud , and shower with cash .
the worst ?
well , they be still average in with the rest .
and anyway , I do not consider analyst anything but aggregator of publically-available information and echo-chamber for previously-determined opinion .
they can not really add much without stray into the realm of inside information , and what they do add be usually factored in the moment the report be release .
or , in a ideal world , it should be .
thankfully , ours be a less-than-ideal , though by no means dystopic , market , so we get plenty of opportunity to profit from the mistake of other .
as long as the bearish opinion of analyst weigh down on Krispy Kreme , I will be a bull .
Byrne 2005-01-20T16:41:00 eBay 's nauseating $ 19.72 decline -lrb- a loss of 19.14 % -rrb- have that end-of-an-era feel , like the Motorola crash describe in the money game or the nadir of the dot.com collapse profile in Dot.con .
there be news , of course -lrb- the only time there be no news whatsoever be when the entire market tank -rrb- , but miss estimate by a penny and show some ` red flag ' should not be a excuse for lop off twice as much as the market have the night before -lrb- after hour , eBay have lose a modest 10 % or so -rrb- .
watch a stock drop after hour , open lower , and close even lower than that make I wonder just who be selling : a runup usually build on a gradual crescendo of greater-fool theory -- everyone think they can always sell to someone dumber -- and end when the greatest fool yet get sick of the whole thing and bail .

Byrne 2005-01-26T07:11:00 Merck post a 21 % decline in earnings thanks to the new post-vioxx announcement .
most of the profit decline be because Vioxx , represent about 11 % of sale , now represent a pretty severe legal headache : not only have they lose the revenue , but they have take a $ 600 million charge as a reserve against future Vioxx loss .
if that be a accurate number , investor should cheer up : Merck 's at fifteen time annualize earnings , twelve time forward earnings , and underappreciate by most of Wall Street .
full disclosure : I own Merck .
I buy the day of the Vioxx announcement .
and if I want to stay that contrarian , I will have to sell only when I get a inside tip that they have cure cancer , AIDS , heart disease , and death .
J. Nathan ????

t19 :49:00 if you read the quarterly more carefully , you will notice that the charge be not relate to liability from Vioxx but merely cost associate with legal defense , i.e. , just the cost of pay the lawyer in all of these case .
if that how much they be willing to pay for legal defense , imagine how much the actual liability be gon na be .
good blog , I find you via you instalanche .
Byrne ????

t22 :43:00 thanks for you compliment .
usually , I do not read the filings as carefully as I should -- I leave it up to alert reader , I guess .
anyway , I still think the Vioxx risk be overestimate -- if the tobacco industry can sell something with no health benefit for year , get sue , and 1 -rrb- keep the product on the shelf , 2 -rrb- remain in business , and 3 -rrb- do 2 -rrb- to the tune of several billion dollar per year in profit , we Merckers might be safe .
Byrne 2005-01-27T07:16:00 one of the rule of thumb that have guide my -lrb- limited -rrb- business career from the beginning be that China be never as lucrative as it look .
this assumption be base on about 150 year of economic history , include several boom in interest and investment in China .
they biggest problem : there be usually a 200-to-1 ratio of nearly starve Peasant Laborers to absurdly well-off government employee .
and now it be a iffier 100-to-1 , since there be also rich private sector employee and the labor force be not quite so expendable .
what they have be miss for year be the real driver behind any consumer economy : consumer .
specifically , they do not have a real middle class .
that be change in the last twenty year , as increase social mobility and a burst in foreign demand have finally make China a genuine , rather than theoretical , contender .
and they have even supply proof of they economic viability , announce that they have beat Japan for export to the US .
if only I would figure this out in early 2002 , when they stock market be by some stretch of the imagination cheap .
Tanger ????

t10 :10:00 I du n no if you want anything to do with they stock market .
for one , its perforance last year be pretty dismal .
more importantly , its a structural nuthouse .
unfortunately , minority shareholder rights be virtually non-existent , and exclude the dodgy financial statement list on the exchange , lot of time company be more interested in generate cash from a ipo then actually bother with shareholder value .
this Economist article -lrb- not sure if registration be require , sorry -rrb- http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=1447832 finally , the Shanghai Composite on July , 1997 be trade at 1189.76 .

Byrne 2005-02-01T07:48:00 Georgia 's insurance Commissioner , John Oxendine , claim that Marsh ` get off the hook ' -- and you can bet he be get a plan to fix that .
perhaps the worst feature of Spitzer 's Attila the hun-like sweep through the financial service industry be he habit of breed imitator , who will essentially use he settlement as a benchmark for create they own demand .
interestingly enough , this morning 's Wall Street Journal report that Marsh pay a higher fee than they need to -- that the $ 850 million number be agree upon at the last minute mainly so Marsh could pay out over a four-year period without admit guilt .
the rhetoric we be hear -- that Marsh may have cost customer billion of dollar -- do not match the reality that in a few case , they manipulate bid , but that the proven damages thus far involve only a few million dollar of business price 5 % or 10 % higher than it otherwise would have be .
Crazy .
full disclosure : I own share of Marsh , and I would not be particularly dissapoint if Eliot Spitzer 's career take a sudden nosedive thanks to , say , question about he business relationship to money manager and allege stock manipulator Jim Cramer .
nothing personal ; I just think he be the fifth horseman of the fiscal apocalypse , represent irresponsible invest with Wild Abandon .
Byrne 2005-02-04T13:22:00 it be always difficult to get use to a central fact of the modern economy : the best new technology will keep get better at a absolutely astounding rate .
usually , the improvement curve flatten pretty fast -- the usual auto industry/computer industry comparison work just fine -lrb- accord to the standard urban legend , Bill Gates note that `` if we would be make car instead of software , you would get 500 mile to the gallon , need a oil change every 250,000 mile , and be able to replace you car for $ 200 , '' to which a mythical GM executive reply `` ah , but if Microsoft make car , they would crash three time a day , too ! '' -rrb-
.
anyway , a few announcement during the last two day underscore the fact that the growth in memory and processing power for computer be far from over : Hewlett-Packard be develop a new replacement for the transistor , and a consortium of software company be back a new technology that would allow disc to hold up to a terabyte of information .
no idea where this will end up : it be not altogether rare that these announcement result in a very expensive project to develop something that , for whatever reason , be not worthwhile to consumer .
but it be important to remember that the status quo be never more than a snapshot -- invest as though it be permanent be a recipe for disaster .
Byrne 2005-02-04T13:37:00 accord to the usually reliable cnn/money , the `` Twin Deficits '' will continue to grow .
interesting terminology ... I believe they be refer to the budget deficit and ... the capital surplus ?
when analyze trade deficit , it be important to realize that the amount by which import exceed export be also equal to the net amount foreign investor have bet on the US .
so the trade deficit be due to a confluence of the pressure from US consumer -lrb- who control about 20 % of global gdp -rrb- and everybody else -lrb- exclude the non-consumption share of US GDP , that would amount to around 75 % of global gdp -rrb- .
which of those be -- probably -- go to be a more important number ?
even if we be consumer bent on gorge ourselves with import goods , the largest pressure on the deficit be that we be simply a better place for investment -- higher return on capital in develop country be more than mitigate by the higher political risk they face .
and what about that other deficit ?
it , of course , be the ominous sum that we fund without tax , but by borrow fund .
and about half of those borrowing end up with the major bank in Asia .
so , not to be a heretic , but 1 -rrb- we be issue they at relatively low interest rate , 2 -rrb- inflation be bind to pick up eventually , and so 3 -rrb- would not you rather have we deficit make up by economically nonsensical purchase by non-us investor , rather than raise tax in America ?
it be a question of who will pay for the same spending , and all else be equal I would be happy for asian central bank to pick up the tab .
the Twin deficit be a reality , but they be not exactly a terrifying one .
Byrne 2005-02-04T17:36:00 the market do not have a intelligent way to react to this news -lrb- except to send NASDAQ , which I have be cheerleading for a while , up 10.46 % in sympathy -rrb- , but the New York Stock Exchange may actually convert to a for-profit entity .
it be far too clubby now , and while this move would not get rid of nine-figure payday , it might ensure that they only happen when well-deserved .
not to name name or anything .
the exchange need this : it be ossify , the real owner -- holder of exchange seat -- have see they investment lose 40 % in a year -lrb- though they can still earn a income from it to offset the loss -rrb- , and the NASDAQ have undercut they traditional dominance among growth companies-turned-blue chip .
heck , they be down to just over half of they single-letter symbol !
it be a die organization , and this will be just the jolt it need for another couple decade of somnambulant staggering before be ultimately replace by far more efficient company .
full disclosure : `` far more efficient company , '' basically mean `` the NASDAQ , '' so take it with a gigantic grain of salt .
secondary disclosure : you can take the above at face value ; I do not own stock in a salt company .

well , I be not sure how I take the NYSE news .
I think I agree with you on the wreckless compensation thing .
I also think that Sears-Kmart should come up with a new name altogether .
those store be deadzone , and they need some buzz .
Change the name , paint the building , reorganize a little , and hire stripper for cashier .

Byrne 2005-02-05T13:58:00 I really miss the day when a major international oil company could basically buy some tiny , ill-established foreign government to get at its natural resource .
we have progress a bit since then : now , the third world country all have they own state oil company , who be pick apart the carcass of once-private concern .
the Capital Spectator report on the latest : not only China , but India 's state oil company have decide to get into the yukos-dismemberment trade .
Byrne 2005-02-06T19:51:00 at first , I be pretty skeptical of Gmail -- a announcement of something new , cool , and free , from a quirky company , on April Fool 's day ?
turn out my initial attitude be not justified , of course , and Gmail have be a popular success .
just this weekend , Google give many user another fifty invitation , prompt some to speculate that it could be the start of Gmail 's final move out of beta .
they marketing be absolutely brilliant : simply through association with Google , and because of the invitation-only membership , they create a product with instant cachet -- something so in demand invitation go for $ 50 on eBay , and one enterprising site even offer a kidney for a invite .
and now ?
everyone who want a Gmail account have one , and yet people with invite have a almost pathological desire to give they away .
it be be nearly a year , the service be nearly ubiquitous , and somehow Google have keep we obsess with Gmail .
want a invite ?
I have get a dozen .

Byrne 2005-02-06T20:09:00 frenetic merger and acquisition activity do not mean much in the early day of a business -- it be just as likely that ridiculously overfunded startup be buy out they bankrupt competitor to create larger and less stable conglomerate as it be that forward-thinking visionary be cut off they competitor early .
but when a outsider buy into the business once it be establish itself as important , but before it be really get profitable , it be big news .

as of this morning , at least .
anyway , it look like they be deny chinese involvement to avoid a lawsuit , which be funny -- you would think they might know someone in the russian judiciary who could help they out .
Byrne 2005-02-08T20:33:00 Today 's performance say a lot about how the market view certain subject ; tomorrow 's will tell we even more .
today , ask Jeeves make they official announcement about acquire blogline .
and tonight , Cisco report solid earnings and weak sale .
the market 's modestly pessimistic reaction to the Bloglines news tell we that blogg be not see as a major profit source yet ; tomorrow 's trading will tell we whether the market be ready to accept that more established technology business be back on track as well .
after hour , Cisco 's be slam , but once they be expose to the rest of the trading population , the result might differ .
Michael ????

t09 :29:00 I do not think blogline will ever be a major source of profit or revenue .
blogg itself could become a pretty big consumer past time like watch tv , read a book , or play video game but I be not sure how blogline really benefit .
I would guess it most benefit the search engine , hit counter , and software builder .
with the explosion in available market commentary that happen through the internet it be not clear to I that by lower the cost of access blogging really add that much as much as it do to political commentary .
maybe seek alpha can become the new tscm but I do not think that will change the landscape as much as Howard Dean 's campaign do .
Byrne 2005-02-08T20:59:00 Stephen of IRA-CAM be experience Sitemeter envy over all those succesful political blog .
understandable !
after all , my biggest surge in hit come from a link from , well , a political blog .
however , I would rather not worry -- instead , I would like to think of we situation as akin to Instapundit , or Andrew Sullivan , or Daily Kos in , say , the summer of 2001 .
blog do not get huge until people see they update continuously on September 11th , and during the primary , and later on during the convention .
in politics , there be a definite four-year cycle , and any new medium can find its voice and carve out a audience in that time .
financial market be not so kind .
in short , we need a crash , and we need to blog it .

Byrne 2005-02-09T19:23:00 Mel Karmazin be push to add Sirius Satellite service to ipod -- a interesting idea , inasmuch as it seem to defeat the purpose of both .
the iPod 's the tiniest possible container for vast music library , and Sirius be a way to get at lot of content when say music library be unavailable .
on the other hand , Karmazin and Jobs be two of the smartest dealmaker around , so they might find a way to structure this or spin it to the benefit of everyone .

not only be the catalyst for she fall from grace a fortune article by Carol Loomis -lrb- who as far as I know be immortal -- she be be write for Fortune since 1954 -rrb- , but the anti-carly brigade be out in full force at Salon.com .
this be get a little harsh ; she might have mess up at HP -lrb- I refuse to call it by the new name , for now -rrb- , but she be not actively try to destroy a great company and wreck the shareholder .
it just , well , happen .
so , right , Carly be a bad manager , and she eventually get what she deserve , but she be not evil incarnate .
Byrne 2005-02-12T16:07:00 I have be keep a careful eye on the Blockbuster / Hollywood machination for a while -lrb- and well I should -- I have stock in one of the deal 's participant , Movie Gallery -rrb- , but even so I be surprised that Blockbuster 's latest gambit be to buy up Hollywood 's debt .
it be a admirable hedge -- if Movie Gallery win , it could improve Hollywood 's rating , and either way it offer Blockbuster some leverage .
and this be , as far as I know , the first time since the Allegheny deal that there be be a hostile takeover use debt .
Byrne 2005-02-12T17:17:00 Joseph Granville , the octogenarian technical analyst , have predict a precipitous decline in stock price this year .
I be a little bearish , myself -lrb- it always help -rrb- , but I have take the liberty of check some alternate source for Granville information , from which I get the follow incident : Granville 's behavior easily attract public attention .
he investment seminar be bizarre extravaganza , sometimes feature a trained chimpanzee who could play Granville 's theme song , `` the Bagholder 's Blues , '' on a piano .
he once show up at a investment seminar dress as Moses , wear a crown and carry tablet .
Granville make extravagant claim for he forecasting ability .
he say he could forecast earthquake and once claim to have predict six of the past seven major world quake .
he be quote by Time magazine as say , `` I do not think that I will ever make a serious mistake in the stock market for the rest of my life , '' and he predict that he would win the Nobel Prize in economics .
sound like a paragon of stability and common sense to I !
Byrne 2005-02-14T21:15:00 I be hope for another incredibly drawn-out story , full of antitrust drama , lurk potential bidder , and contentious confrontation between executive .
and then MCI just sort of accept a Verizon deal without really bother anybody .
clearly , they corporate culture have suffer -- 25 year ago , MCI be the brawl upstart in the telecom industry , constantly challenge AT&T 's right to exist , much less to monopolize the phone system .
and now , they be swallow by just another monolith .
I expect better -- meaner and tougher , sure , but better nonetheless .
Byrne 2005-02-15T18:58:00 G 's invest argue that Alan Greenspan be a George lucas-esque figure : in the Star Wars universe of George Lucas , he portray a benevolent dictatorship -lrb- or benevolent monarchy -rrb- as be superior to a democracy , with the democracy be the system rife with bureaucracy and bloat .
with Greenspan 's unspoken position as economic czar , that be what we have right now : a benevolent dictatorship of the Fed .
but one of the why dictatorship be so inferior to democracy be that democracy offer a stable , peaceful transfer of power .
will we have that at the Fed , when Greenspan leave indeed .

t19 :19:00 can not remember where I see this , maybe at socialsecuritychoice.org .
anyways , the battle line for social security privatization be be identify as those who be for choice and ownership -lrb- Bush -rrb- , versus those who equate investing in the sp500 as play the slot machine -lrb- aarp , most Democrats , etc -rrb- .
the battle be now for the endorsement of Sir Alan Greenspan .
where will Dr. Greenshades come down in this debate ?
what will he say on privatization and the associate cost with implement such a system ?
I think that will have a pretty big impact on what happen next ... Byrne ????

t19 :25:00 Ooohhh ... I can not tell you how much I want to take side here , but I be try to keep my political opinion out of this -- I would really hate to alienate half my political audience in a single endorsement .
so I will just note that I do not see it as quite so black-and-white , and I think some of the compromise -lrb- like reduce tax for parent , on the grounds that child be the asset back Social Security -rrb- might be useful and -- we be deal with a win-or-lose , vote-or-not situation -- practical .

t21 :16:00 yeah , I be interested in hear some obtuse Greenspanisms regard this topic ...
Byrne 2005-02-16T21:20:00 Northshore Management , the hedge fund firm accuse of steal million of dollar in client fund , be now face actual SEC action .
the amount in question : $ 37 million .
while it be not a major sum compare to the amount consider before -lrb- as high as $ 90 million -rrb- , it be good to see that the issue 's get resolve .
Though , of course , there be always the chance that these fund manager be stupid and shortsighted , not actually criminal ; apparently , the money steal be lend to or invest in company the manager control -- so they be guilty of front-running , at the least .
but they might have be use Northshore as a alternative source of capital : have invest all they could risk , it would only make sense to turn to other source .
what we will need to look for in the come week be 1 -rrb- what happen to the money once it be invest in these company -lrb- be they real company , or just avenue for steal fund ? -rrb-
and 2 -rrb- how much of this be disclose beforehand .
Byrne 2005-02-17T21:15:00 have the EU once again lose its mind ?
the one industry in which Europe incontrovertibly beat the US be they aviation industry , thanks mainly to the fact that they lawmaker have leave the operation of the industry up to the people who own it , and leave passenger 's rights in the hand of choosy passenger .
and now they be ready to ` fix ' that with a new package of ill-advised rule completely change the nature of airline .
before , a potential customer could choose between a cosy , near-certain ride from a expensive company or a hustle , uncomfortable , and absurdly cheap one from a smaller competitor .
and now ?
not a chance .
Byrne 2005-02-22T07:29:00 read this report on the U.S.-Russia Technology Symposium .
it be a great summary of the paradox of the russian economy : they have a huge untapped supply of valuable it labor , but they it export be only a tenth of they military export -lrb- and only a thirtieth of India 's it export -rrb- .
they develop lot of new technology , but nobody can tell who own what .
and , of course , they security law and property rights be even flimsier than China 's -- after the Putin administration mug Yukos on the grounds that it be too attractive a target to leave alone , they lose a lot of trust .
still , they have a unbelieveable amount of untapped potential .
Byrne 2005-02-22T19:19:00 I can think of only one good reason to be this enthusiastic about Martha Stewart live : the fact that so many investor be so clearly enthusiastic about Martha Stewart live .
let 's be clear : there be few worse time to buy a stock than when the namesake and guide force behind the company be in prison -lrb- whether or not she really should be -rrb- , advertising be down by nearly half , and the brand have be tarnish beyond recognition .
and yet the stock 's within a few point of a all-time high .
wonder never cease .
Byrne 2005-02-25T05:41:00 Well , I would , too .
on the other hand , the russian legal system be a bit less , well , legalistic -- they seem much more concerned about the chance that someone will harm the state than about actual matter of right and wrong .
so it be pretty significant that Mikhail Khodorkovsky be take the risk of maintain he innocence .
at this point , he have essentially no chance of recover anything , unless Russia see a change in political control and the US apply some pressure .
Byrne 2005-02-26T13:07:00 we all know by now that Choicepoint allow some highly respectable nigerian businessman of impeccable credentials to view hundred of thousand of customer record for entirely legitimate purpose -- they be pay customer , after all , and the customer be Always Right .
but even after that huge mistake -- or rather , because of it -- the company 's top executive begin dump share like mad .
what be scary be that since they start sell , the stock 's down about 5 % .
clearly , they be expect lot more damage .
these insider sale be certainly stupid , and probably criminal -lrb- though the legal proof may be hard to come by -rrb- but the solution be easy enough : they need to buy stock from the company itself , at some premium to the price at which they sell -- they will have the same stake as before , the shareholder would have get they money back -lrb- since the premium go to the company , which be own by the shareholder -rrb- , and there be no need to disrupt they business by take the matter to court .
or , if you want to do thing the SEC 's way , you could 1 -rrb- hire a bunch of lawyer with the company 's -lrb- shareholder ' -rrb- money , 2 -rrb- hire a legion of pr firm to explain away that frivolous spending , 3 -rrb- hire a new accountant to magically turn that spending into a investment amortizable over twenty year , and 4 -rrb- settle out-of-court by have the exec give the SEC some pittance -lrb- for which they will likely be compensate by the company -rrb- and a statement that `` we neither admit nor deny that we do what you claim , but we will never do it again . ''
thank God for the SEC -- they have practically make it a shareholder 's utopia , here .
Byrne 2005-02-26T14:44:00 Good plan ; cigarette impose pretty high penalty on state , inasmuch as the state be caretaker for plenty of people who be ill thanks to cigarette .
what be notable in this debate , however , be that accord to MSN Moneycentral , tobacco executive be attack the tax by note that `` while North Carolina 's excise tax be only 5 cent , the total tax give to North Carolina by smoker add up to more than 61 cent per pack . ''
okay , okay -- since the tobacco company pay lot of money to the state , that be technically accurate .
but the point of these tax be to align the price of a pack with the cost to society , and inasmuch as these penalty be not assess on a per-pack basis , they do not -- they be a lump-sum reflection of the tax these company ought to have pay before .
interestingly , the policy of make cigarette buyer pay to compensate society for the cost they impose be a politically palatable synthesis of the unpalatable notion of simply refuse treatment unless they pay full cost .
they be basically buy future medical care throughout they life , rather than eventually make the -lrb- healthy -rrb- remainder of the populace pay up .
in short : good plan .
Byrne 2005-02-28T22:11:00 you would think he be busy enough with Blockbuster and Hollywood , but Carl Icahn be once again go after Mylan lab .
I would love to call it a classic raid -- he be make a offer for the company , nominate he own board , claim management can accept one or the other or both , and hint that if they pay he enough , he would probably go away .
but the whole point of raiding be to outsmart a opponent , and that mean the strategy change constantly .
in this case , the most interesting twist be that he be short share of Mylan 's acquisition target , King Pharmaceuticals ; he be basically double down on the bet that they will not acquire .
not only that , but if Mylan buy he out , they would have less money to fund a purchase of King Pharmaceuticals .
either way , he be show a lot of confidence .
give he record , it be warrant .
John A 2004-12-24t10:07:00 for my holiday post , I offer a message of hope for the business world .
in 1994 , I be a graduate student in Boston .
I be ask to moderate a panel discussion on social entrepreneurship for a conference at Harvard Business School .
the conference be be hold by a new group call student for responsible business .
I expect to see a small gathering of idealistic , slightly naive MBA student .
what I find be a packed room of 200 intelligent , practical , driven idealist .
these student be determine to figure out how to use business as a driver for positive social change .
I leave that room with my eye open to the possibility present by these future business leader .
fast forward 10 year .
student for responsible business be now call net impact .
in 2004 , I have the opportunity to attend they conference host by the University of Texas McCombs Business School .
net impact have grow to include over 9,000 MBA student and alumnus .
approximately 900 people attend the 2004 conference .
the buzz word fly around the conference include social entrepreneurship , sustainable profitability , work with passion .
I meet student after student intent on harness the force of business and capitalism to improve the world .
these student understand that business be a powerful lever of change in this world .
recently business school have receive they share of criticism for turn out graduate who seem to have lose sight of they responsibility for ethical action .
I can tell you that I be see a powerful groundswell of change come from within business school .
it be not come from the faculty , or the alumnus , or the administration .
all these group continue to pay lipservice to topic of social responsibility while avoid any real innovation in the student experience .
the change be be demand by the student .
a little secret of business school be that MBA student have a immense amount of sway .
few choose to use it , but if they want they can fundamentally change they school .
right now student at business school be ask for more discussion of these topic in class , be initiate service project , form support group for social entrepreneur , invite speaker to campus to discuss sustainability , social investing , non-profit innovation , etc. .
net impact be often at the center of these effort .
these be not isolate event ... this be a revolution from within .
I have no doubt that in 10 year we will see the vast positive impact that these student be have in the world of business and society at large .
in 1776 Adam Smith speak of enlighten self-interest in the wealth of nation .
I often feel that we have conveniently forget he emphasis on enlighten which he define as be commit to be a good citizen and steward of society .
I be excited and hopeful that this new generation of business leader will bring this emphasis front and center .
if you be a MBA student and want a good reference for compare how MBA program integrate issue of sustainability and social responsibility into the student experience a good place to start be the Beyond Grey Pinstripes report produce by the Aspen Institute .
happy holiday to everyone !!
John A 2005-01-03T09:44:00 here be a entertaining little morsel from Business Week Online -lrb- no byline give -rrb- : but on the subject of succession , those two look like role model compare with insurance giant American International Group Inc. -lrb- AIG -rrb- , whose aging ceo have no plan to retire .
Maurice R. `` Hank '' Greenberg , who turn 80 in May , groom two son to be successor , but both have since leave AIG.Greenberg Sr. then create a office of the chairman in 2002 , which include co-coo Martin J. Sullivan and Donald P. Kanak .
both be consider possible successor , but the board will not know Greenberg 's preference until he departure , when it open a sealed letter .
perhaps this be a good time for a quick refresher ... .
the CEO work for the board ... end lesson .
I guess it be not as straight forward when you ceo be also chairman and one of the largest shareholder .
it would be tempting to get on my high horse right now about the need to separate the position of CEO and Chairman but to be honest with you I do not really believe that .
I know CEO/chair duality be a popular cause for corporate governance .
however there be little empirical evidence to suggest that separate these role affect firm performance in either a positive or negative way .
have a combined ceo/chairman do reduce the ability of the board to act as a check on management and this do mean that you need to be more critical in you assessment of the trustworthiness of the top management team .
this downside of have a combined CEO/chair be offset by -lrb- 1 -rrb- a reduction of coordination and communication cost at the top of the organization and -lrb- 2 -rrb- a increase in the negotiate position of the CEO when deal with supplier , potential merger partner , etc. # 2 could be particularly useful in a dynamic industry .
I do however look more carefully at the top management team of a company with a ceo/chair before invest .
it be important that you can get a sense of the trustworthiness of the CEO .
be there high turnover among senior manager ?
be there a record of regulatory problem ?
if the CEO be new , I also look at the performance of the CEO 's previous company .
I be most concerned if the fortune of the prior employer take a sudden turn for the worse after the CEO leave .
John A 2005-01-05T09:22:00 yesterday 's bad day for Krispy Kreme include some speculation that the new security lawsuit file against the company would be grant class action status .
if you be interested in get information about security class action for a company , you should check out the Stanford Law School 's Securities Class Action Clearinghouse .
this site have a very easy to use search function and it might be worth the time to run a quick check on company of interest to you as possible investment .
researcher affiliate with the clearinghouse just release a interesting report about security class action trend during 2004 .
the result highlight trend in type of filings -lrb- increase in product market related filings -rrb- , affect sector -lrb- big increase in energy & technology sector -rrb- , and overall number of filings -lrb- fairly steady -rrb- .
get the full report here or the press release here .
John A 2005-01-08T13:23:00 it be just about time for Fortune magazine to release its 2005 list of 100 best company to work for .
so now be a good time to ask a simple question : why should we care ?
make this list be certainly a source of pride .
it can also be helpful if you be look for a nice new job .
should anyone else pay attention to this list ?
well , thanks for ask because I just happen to have a answer for that question .
it turn out that investor can benefit by pay attention to this list as well .
in a study publish in the Journal of Business Finance & Accounting -lrb- 2003 , 30:771 -798 -rrb- , Greg Filbeck and Dianna Preece find that company on the Fortune list of 100 best company to work for outperform a match sample of firm along multiple measure of return .
this study be particularly relevant for investor because the author measure return after the list be announce .
to often these study use as a start point the moment before information become public .
the only way to benefit from such information be by hold the stock before the information become public .
this study indicate that the best company to work for information may still be useful even after the information become public .
it might also be useful to look at company that have consistently make the list in the previous few year and make a educate guess about they inclusion on this year 's list .
search the news archive and see if in the past year the company do anything that might have totally piss off they employee .
massive layoff , bitter union battle , stop offer free massage , etc. .
you might also want to be wary if the CEO or a bunch of other top executive have be replace .
that can often generate a period of uncertainty in a workforce .
John A 2005-01-09t19:47:00 I can not for the life of I figure out why anyone would invest in the airline industry .
please , someone tell I a group company face more serious problem than the legacy airline carrier -lrb- delta , US Airways , Continental , American , Northwestern , United -rrb- .
high fuel cost , insane pension obligation , and a highly pay , specialize workforce .
to this list of woe , we add a whole slew of competitor with much lower cost structure .
I admit I have already take advantage of the lower fare announce last week to book a business trip but these next few year be not go to be pretty for some of these company .
unfortunately , the pain be not limit to these company .
Pittsburgh , one of US Airway 's hub , build up its airport complete with a sprawling retail complex in the terminal .
now US Airways have reduce flight out of Pittsburgh by 28 % since January of 2004 and be in real danger of folding completely .
these shiny new airport be usually finance by long-term bond that still have to pay off ... but not by the airline .
this be a industry look for a sustainable strategy .
Southwest and JetBlue be the only major airline to earn a profit in 2004 but who know what will be happen in another five year .
so I will thankfully accept the low fare , bemoan the loss of food on flight , and watch these company parade in and out of bankruptcy .
BusinessWeek Online have some other commentary about the fare cut here and about US Airway 's woe here .
John A 2005-01-10T10:09:00 remember how you stress every year to get those # % ^ ^ $ % # tax form file on time ?
just imagine how Nortel feel .
early on Tuesday Nortel will be file its 2003 financial statement .
it also expect to restate 2001 and 2002 earnings .
none of this be really new information .
so the worst be behind they right ?
maybe .
late filing of audited financial statement and earn restatement both factor into my external Reporting organizational indicator .
as a rule , I be wary of company that do either of these thing until I be confident that they have change they standard business practice .
it may take a couple year , and several more financial filings -lrb- on time of course -rrb- , before I be persuade to take a second look at the company .
the bottom line be that I rely on SEC filings to assess company and I do not want to have any doubt about the veracity of the information contain in these document .
in Nortel 's defense , they have just go through the perfect storm in the telecommunications equipment sector .
the whole industry overbuilt and get blindside by the tech downturn .
this could be describe as a growth industry that go on a bender and be now try to recover from the hangover .
I have always feel that you learn a lot about someone when you see how they try to recover from a hangover -lrb- pause for brief college flashback -rrb- .
this be a great time to assess organizational effectiveness in the telecommunications equipment industry .
Nortel and Lucent attempt to hide the damage -lrb- what do you mean ?
I be not drunk ! -rrb-
and hope for a uptick in demand before they would have to come clean .
both company have be penalize for these action and have continue to restructure operation , sell asset , and layoff employee .
Cisco , on the other hand , be able to take one huge restructuring charge in 2001 and move forward .
they ability to do this and have it work -lrb- so far -rrb- indicate a very deep and impressive understanding of they organization .
especially when compare to its competitor , Cisco seem to be back in fight form due to it be ability to rapidly assess its organizational structure and reconfigure to meet the change market .
not bad for a company with a hangover !
John A 2005-02-03T10:00:00 The 2005 Business Blogging award be now open for voting .
this be a great place to find a number of interesting site .
I find a number of blog that I enjoy among the nomination .
I expect I will be add to my blogroll from this list .
little ole Monty 's Bluff be in the run for best New Business Blog .
I be glad to be in such good company .
so take a few seconds , head on over and cast you vote .
John A 2005-02-03T21:02:00 socially responsible investing .
corporate social responsibility .
just say these word seem to elicit some fairly simplistic knee-jerk reaction .
the reaction that I find most amusing be the know look of sympathy .
you know , the one that say `` Poor naive soul .
if only you understand economics , you would understand the folly of you way . ''
I do not intend to get into the stakeholder vs stockholder debate here or argue the relative merit of Atlas Shrugged .
those discussion , though interesting , avoid a simpler question .
do measure of corporate social responsibility contain valuable add information that help investor pick win investment ?
if all that you have read about this topic be a article in Business Week or the Wall Street Journal , you have probably hear the standard answer -- the evidence be mixed .
that be true but not very reveal would not you say ?
evidence be mixed mostly because -lrb- 1 -rrb- there be little agreement about how to measure social responsibility and -lrb- 2 -rrb- many current measure toss together a heap of information that have no business be lump together .
Social responsibility often include everything from treatment of employee to type of product produce .
there be not really any reason to believe that sell gun or tobacco have anything to do with force employee to work unpaid overtime .
yet both get lump together in the socially responsible invest discussion .
once you start to break apart social responsibility into its various component , you start to see the valuable information .
company that have poor employee relation tend to underperform , as do company that pollute at a higher rate than they industry peer .
on the other hand , company with numerous nlrb violation do not do worse than they peer and company that sell you typical `` sin '' product -lrb- tobacco , firearm , gambling -rrb- can be excellent investment .
lump all these thing together and of course you will get mixed result .
take separately , they provide valuable information about future firm performance .
I guess it be time to get beyond the image of the greedy capitalist vs. hippie tree hugger in this discussion .
though that would make a great Celebrity Death Match episode .
here be abstract from 16 significant study about socially responsible investing and a interesting essay on the subject .
John A 2005-02-04T11:55:00 yesterday be a tough day for the Seattle scene .
Amazon end the day down 14.6 % .
starbuck down 8.2 % .
I should disclose that I spend a few year live in Seattle and I have a soft spot in my heart for all thing Seattle .
as far as I could tell , many people in the Northwest spend the morning drink latte and they evening drink microbrew .
really not a bad lifestyle .
anyway , back on topic here .
market over reaction ?
hard to say .
both company have pricey stock and those valuation be base on optimistic expectation of future growth .
yesterday 's news lead many to question they growth assumption for these company .
today I want to talk a bit about Starbucks .
I think I have to start by acknowledge that the stock be still pricey even after its drop yesterday .
however , my organizational indicator analysis reveal a very low level of business risk .
this may partially justify a higher P/E ratio .
a couple week ago , I observe that Wal-Mart have offset strong and weak organizational indicator .
Starbucks , on the other hand , have uniformly strong organizational indicator .
Starbucks score as best in its industry on six of seven organizational indicator .
not surprising be its strong score in the employee relation and stakeholder action indicator .
its weakest score be in the external reporting indicator .
in the past , several observer have raise concern about aggressive accounting at Starbucks but my analysis do not indicate any systematic current issue .
the weak score be primarily the result of Starbucks current strategy of increase equity ownership of several foreign subsidiary .
this be a strategic shift that have short-term cost and add some uncertainty to the financial statement .
beyond the strong organizational indicator analysis , several additional factor favor Starbucks ability to continue to grow revenue .
1 .
Starbucks have little debt .
Starbucks be not currently finance its growth with debt .
consider its growth , this be amazing .
it also mean that Starbucks have a large amount of flexibility in how it finance future growth .
the company can assume much more debt without negatively affect its risk profile because ... 2 .
Starbucks have a healthy cashflow and current cash position .
this allow the company to grow without debt .
you could argue that Starbucks have too much cash and should do more to pass it on to shareholder .
this option be another way that Starbucks have retain its flexibility for the future .
3 .
Starbucks be the primary owner of its store and limit franchise .
while Starbucks do partner -lrb- airline , airport , Barnes & Noble -rrb- , most of its store be company own .
from a managerial perspective this greatly simplify cost structure , product change , and quality control .
take together all of these factor paint a picture of a company with a very strong future .
I can not say if these factor justify the current share price but I would say that they justify a higher P/E ratio than the industry norm .
risk be lower .
interesting aside : Starbucks be take over the location in my town that be recently abandon by Krispy Kreme .
disclosure : at the time of this write I do not own Starbucks stock ... but I be tempt and might consider a buy next week .
I be also tempt to go buy a latte after write this post .
tracy 2005-02-23t10:49:00 get job ?
and so , I have rejoin the world of the fully employ .
after Christmas , I get a call from the wife of one of my former boss -lrb- at my last full-time job -rrb- .
she be look for a Development Assistant at the retirement community where she work .
I start here 4 week ago .
WM be affiliate with , but not run or fully support by , the denomination I have be a part of all my life -lrb- umc -rrb- .
my grandmother -lrb- who be Baptist -rrb- live here for a few month before she die in 1995 , so I have many connection to the job .
we office be in one of the patio home , and I have my own lovely office with a window .
the job 's only about 12 mile from home , and I be go against the bulk of the traffic morning and afternoon .
it all seem perfect and yet ... oh , I be so thankful to be somewhere so nice where I might actually make a difference in people 's life , and I want to keep a open mind and hope it will last forever , but I have a feeling I will be restless within a year or so .
my boss be a very nice person , but conservative and resistant to technology , i.e. computer , internet , etc. .
we just get new computer a week and half ago , and she be gripe about xp -lrb- she old os be Windows 98 -- mine be 95 , so I be thrill with the new stuff -rrb- .
I tell she it will just take some get use to .
we will see .
I be not make the kind of salary I be hope to get , but it be the best salary I have get thus far .
when I be fulltime in radio I make a little less , but I get quite a few remote , which make up for not get a topnotch salary .
I be still do my tv announce and my weekend radio stuff , so that money will help .
I be go to start actively pursue more voice work in the next month or so , too .
my plan be to pay off my car early , and then work on the other debt .
I think it be time to go on and fill out the adoption application .
I be terrify of more debt , but mom and Dad will help with the money .
I be not sure they realize how expensive it all be .
I be think we might lean toward adopt from Guatemala , but we have still not hash it all out .
it be almost bad make some money now , because while most of I want to save as much as possible , the other , smaller part be scream loudly for stuff , stuff , stuff !!!
I have get a trial subscription to XM at work because of the Dell computer , and now I be lust to have it all of the time .
g get I a nice office stereo for my birthday and it do have a aux jack , so I could listen to it here .
he ask if I want a car stereo , and I say no , but I do .
there be so many thing I want .
a garage .
a dining room set .
New stuff for we house .
New clothes .
New everything .
but I want family more .
I think part of the draw of the other stuff be I could get it now .
but I would be pay for it later .
Money make the world go round and round and round til I be just dizzy .
