-LRB- MARKET UPDATE -RRB- And this final story : retired Senator Strom Thurmond has never made a secret about his fondness for young , pretty women .
So some think Thurmond 's travel plans in South Carolina next month are rather fitting .
He 'll fly to his first public appearance since returning to his home state aboard the private jet of a Hooters Air executive .
Hooters Air is a spin-off of a restaurant chain known for its scantily clad waitresses .
But a local Republican official insists there will not be any Hooters girls onboard with the 100-year-old Thurmond .
Smiles .
That 's it for INSIDE POLITICS .
