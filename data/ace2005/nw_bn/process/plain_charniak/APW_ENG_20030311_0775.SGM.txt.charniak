<s> ANKARA , Turkey -LRB- AP -RRB- The charismatic leader of Turkey 's governing party was named prime minister Tuesday , a step that probably boosts chances that the United States will get permission to deploy troops in the country along Iraq 's northern border . </s>
<s> Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who favors the deployment , hinted that he will reshuffle the Cabinet , but gave no indication if he would purge officials who opposed letting in the troops as analysts have suggested he might do . </s>
<s> Erdogan is extremely popular in Turkey and is likely be one of the few leaders with enough clout to unite his party and gain public support for allowing in the U.S. troops . </s>
<s> Turks overwhelmingly oppose a war _ by 94 percent , according to some polls . </s>
<s> Earlier this month , the Turkish parliament shocked the United States by rejecting the deployment by just four votes . </s>
<s> Erdogan has hinted that he will resubmit the resolution for approval , which could take another week . </s>

<s> It would also threaten Turkey 's possible role in the future of Iraq . </s>
<s> Turkey , which fears northern Iraqi Kurds may declare independence in the aftermath of a war , has been pressing for a say if Saddam Hussein is ousted . </s>

<s> Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld said Tuesday there had been talks that Turkish troops could be deployed `` a short distance from their border to try to avoid refugee infiltration . '' </s>

<s> Rumsfeld also said that like Turkey , the United States does n't want to see a breakaway state : `` Our interest , needless to say , is to see that Iraq remains a single country , '' he said at the Pentagon news conference . </s>
<s> Prime Minister Abdullah Gul resigned earlier Tuesday to make way for Erdogan , who won a parliamentary seat in by-elections Sunday . </s>

<s> Gul 's resignation had been long expected . </s>

<s> The Justice party changed the constitution after taking power in the elections . </s>
<s> Erdogan , a leader of Turkey 's pro-Islamic movement when he was jailed , said he moderated his policies in prison . </s>
<s> His party considers itself conservative and no longer uses the word ` Islamic ' in its literature . </s>
<s> He now also advocates letting in U.S. troops for a war against Iraq even though it is a fellow Muslim state . </s>

<s> `` Erdogan will be willing to engage in a bruising confrontation in a way that Gul was not willing to , '' said Bulent Aliriza , an analyst at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies . </s>
<s> `` If Erdogan decides that for his own reasons , and not U.S. pressure , he wants this , he will push it through . '' </s>
