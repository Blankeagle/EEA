in the african nation of nigeria , an islamic court delayed the appeal of a woman condemned to death by stoning .
the court says it will not hear this case until late August .
the 31-year-old mother of three was convicted in march of having sex outside of marriage .
three other nigerians also face stoning deaths for the same crime .
the prosecution of premarital or extramarital sex is not quite as rare as you might think .
our next guest this morning faced 100 lashes for premarital sex in pakistan .
she was there as a journalist in the wake of the 9\/11 attacks .
she has written about her experience in the book `` tantrika '' traveling the road of divine love .
a traveling reporter now on leave and joins us to tell her story .
thank you for coming in to share this with us .
as i understand it , you say you were facing a sentence of 100 lashes , had not yet been sentenced that ?
