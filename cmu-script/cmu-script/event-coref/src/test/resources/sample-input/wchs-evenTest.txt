China has fired back at the Trump administration¡¯s plans for a new ¡°Indo- Pacific¡± strategy to counter Beijing¡¯s growing economic and security hold on the region, warning that the world¡¯s two biggest powers should not be treating their rivalry as a ¡°zero-sum game¡±. 	 
Ahead of a visit to Asia by President Donald Trump this week, the Chinese ambassador to Washington told reporters any US effort to contain China¡¯s rise or intervene in the South China Sea would be viewed with scorn by Beijing.
¡°I don¡¯t think it will be in the interest of any countries if their aim is to contain China,¡± Cui Tiankai said yesterday. ¡°I don¡¯t think anybody would be able to contain China?.?.?.?We don¡¯t have a zero-sum game in the Asia-Pacific. We recognise the interest of the United States in the Asia-Pacific and we want to co-operate with the United States.¡± 	 
The White House has been working for months on an Asia strategy that people involved bill as a more robust response to a China they see as a predatory economic and trade power to which past US administrations have been too willing to bend. Mr Trump is due next week to add detail in a speech on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Vietnam.	 	 
Senior US officials, including Rex Tillerson, secretary of state, have been pointing to India and Japan as allies in an ¡°Indo-Pacific¡± alliance as a bulwark against China in both security and economic terms. They are eager to counter the view that Mr Trump, with his withdrawal from the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact, has been forfeiting US leadership in the region.	 	 
This month Mr Tillerson warned that countries were being seduced by cheap loans from China as part of its ¡°Belt and Road initiative¡± that would eventually lead to Beijing gaining sovereignty over important strategic economic assets in other countries. The US is now discussing a menu of high-grade military hardware sales to India. Jim Mattis, US defence secretary, spent last week on a tour of Southeast Asian countries in a bid to unify the region against China. 	 
Mr Mattis repeatedly affirmed the importance of freedom of navigation through vital trade routes and sovereignty, an indirect reference to China building controversial artificial islands equipped with military installations in the South China Sea.
